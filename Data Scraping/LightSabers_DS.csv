I love this product. It is so neat to be able to put in our sons nursery that is Stars Wars themed. It is great to be able to use as a night light and not have to worry about turning it off since it has its own timer. I was sad that I missed when it was on sale but this particular purchase is worth it since it not only has just one color, but can cycle through nine different colors. I purchased two of them as decor and am able to use just one remote to control them both, which saves money on batteries too. Overall, I am very happy with this product as a decorative wall light! DJ84NV VS Most helpful negative review 1 customer found this helpful 1 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Star Wars Lightsaber Room Light - PIECE OF GARBAGE I was so excited to give this to my Star Wars-crazy niece for her 6th birthday. Brand new out of the box, new batteries....DOES NOT WORK. She is so disappointed as am I. Unfortunately the box it came in got tossed so now I'm stuck with this non-functioning piece of garbage. Won't ever buy anything from manufacturer called Uncle Milton "" again.

This is exactly what I thought it would be. It does different color and lightsaber noises too. My husband loves it and we will hang it in our room. It is small but I expected it to be. Kelena 0 0 5 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase 7/29/2014 5 yr. old best bday gift my son lovs the lightsaber room light. He has 2 that cross just a little at their ends. They work by remote which is cool because he can light them while in bed. They change colors and perhaps the best feature is they make the light saber on off sound as you turn them on and off. It does shut off on it's own after a period of time. Easy to install. Don't know how long they hold up as we just bought them. So far, I would definitely by again. kookabonga 0 0 4 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase 1/27/2017 nice decor The Lightsaber was a nice piece for our room but for some reason the light did not come on all the time. I made contact with the merchant and they quickly issued a credit and made it right. I am very pleased with service department and how quickly they helped us. momoftwoboys 0 0 4 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase 11/6/2013 Fits perfectly with our Star Wars theme.

DJ84NV 3 0 4 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase 12/28/2013 Great simple kids project. This was a big hit with my 6 yr old son he is a big starwars fan. It starts as a assembly project with your child then functions as a light saber toy if they are careful. Then you can mount it to the wall and with the included remote control it is a night light. I would have given it 5 stars if they would have made the wall mount differently. Even though you can remove it from the wall after the mount is screwed to it, its a little clumbsy to handle. It would've been easy to make it work both ways. Not sure their reasoning. But its still very cool. The light source is nice and bright where it lights up the whole tube. mdpry 0 0 See all reviews ONE Debit Card Debit with rewards.Get 3% cash back at Walmart, upto $50 a year.See terms for eligibility.

Now we are super excited to be able to bring this model to you guys as soon as we are I’m sure the saber enthusiasts out there will recognize the inspiration behind this model and if you don’t recognize it I’m sure they’ll fill you in to the comments and all the forums so don’t worry sure it’s there already so yeah we are super excited that we could bring this matter to you guys and let’s get right to it let’s go over the features on the Fallen. To top to bottom here on the emitter we got the windows here loud and that of course is the sound of the best sound board on the market the Obsidian USB but back to it these windows here they let the ladder on both the front and the rear so you have windows in the emitter on the front and the rear and then we have this accent button here this is actually on the front and the rear as well. So you’ve got the windows and the accent button on the emitter and then moving on down to the body this grip here I’m not sure if you can see the texture on it sure you can see it in the pictures though if it’s not showing up in the video but this is one of the most comfortable grips on anybody most Ultra Sabers that I’ve felt it is extremely comfortable in your hand you guys are gonna be very happy with how this one feels that’s like just it’s one of those sabers you just want to pick up just to hold it and fit it in your hands but uh yeah. So, the texture on the grip is uh very grippy so you guys are definitely gonna like this and move it on down to the Covertec Wheel, each and every Fallen will come with the Covertec Wheel to match the anodized on the hilt and then the pommel. So, this pommel is actually pretty unique, and it does create a nice resonance chamber for the sound there. Wow so it’s gonna actually help with the volume on the Fallen. So what else have you got so let’s go over the two versions of the emitter so the combat rated version here and then we have the standard version so first unless you guys know what the difference is technically the standard version these fins are held in place with pins so pins hold these two the emitter on the combat rate of version these fins are held in place with screws that are hidden behind these accent pieces on the emitter so these are the fins are held firmly in place with screws and on the standard version is held in place with pins. Neither one is flimsy I mean these are solidly on here so these are just held in place with screws so practically what does that mean if you are going to be fighting full force with adult men or women we do recommend that you get the combat rated version if there’s a chance that someone is going to hit your fins with the blade full force we do recommend that you get the combat rated version. This is going to withstand that if you’re just using this for a cosplay what’s spinning what else we got here just to add to your collection then this is gonna be great and again this is more true to the inspiration behind the hilt but I personally do really like these accent pieces on the combat rated version there’s just my personal preference and just it’s been a little cool they had a nice flare to the hilt but again more true to the inspiration of the hilt it’s a standard version so that’s the difference there. And at Ultra Sabers we always want to give you guys a choice so you can build the saber of your dreams so yeah that’s what we have here there’s two different emitters combat rated and Non-Combat Rated and we are going to be offering both the pommel and the emitter standalone are on the website so you guys can look for those in the parts section. I think that’s everything like I said I’m extremely happy we’re able to bring those guys just the saber out to you guys as soon as we are so I’m sure you cosplayers out there looking forward to getting your hands on this one so you can a store order or whatever it is you got when they do what your Fallen just uh yeah. And again combat so if you guys are going to be fighting with this we do recommend a combat rated version and of course a heavy grade blade and I believe that is everything oh yeah of course we got to show you guys the different version so this is this is the Fallen here the black and blue we have the Azure Fallen and then in red we have the Crimson Fallen and then in gold we have the Fallen LE. So unbelievably pretty much everything the Fallen does comes standard with the AV switch the metal switch so there that’s not something you guys have to worry about that’s a standard feature on the fallen I think that’s everything. If you guys have any questions of course you can email us and like I said a lot of exciting stuff coming your way the Fallen is amazing and actually what I think you guys are gonna be most excited about what the Fallen it’s the price point as you can see this is a nice sized saber with a nice amount of features and I’m extremely happy we can bring it to you guys at the price point that we are. So yeah, I think you guys are gonna be very happy with the price point on the Fallen so happy we were able to get this release at this price point in it at this timeframe for you guys, so I hope you guys enjoyed the video and I really hope you guys enjoyed the saber and as always thanks for watching.    Ultrasabers Fallen Description Cal Kestis Lightsaber: The Fallen Custom Lightsaber Ultrasabers is proud to present: The Fallen  From top to bottom, The Fallen is packed with features we love, and we’re THRILLED to be able to offer it at such an affordable price point for such an awesome saber.  The first thing you’ll notice about The Fallen is its twin fins that flank the emitter, and stylishly cover the anodized rings that wrap it.  On the exposed sides of the emitter rest twin vertical windows that give the saber an AWESOME look when it’s ignited.  The Fallen emitter is available in two styles, a Combat Ready, and Standard.  We HIGHLY recommend the Combat Ready emitter for those of you who might find your saber being fiercely impacted by your opponent’s own heavy grade blade.  We’ve machined the hilt of the Fallen to have one of the most comfortable grips that we’ve ever added to one of our sabers, and anodized it to give it a solid look in each of our four standard colors.  The simple machining across the hilt gives the Fallen a fantastic feeling in the hand and is perfect for single or two-handed combat.  Each Fallen will come standard with an AV switch, and covertec wheel.  The covertec wheel will be anodized to match the color of the hilt and etching on the rest of your saber.  Finally, the pommel really sets off this saber.  The Fallen sports a totally new and unique pommel, and has been designed as a resonance chamber to amplify the volume on your Obsidian Soundboards, should you elect to equip one to your saber (which we obviously recommend).  The Fallen ships completely assembled and ready for combat out of the box.  The emitter and pommel are MHS (Modular Hilt System) Compatible, meaning that they are removable and interchangeable with any other MHS compatible parts on any other saber in your collection.  The pommel of the Fallen will be available individually.

DELIVERY & RETURN AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY TIMES Main factory (China) - High stock Made on order at factory : 20-25 days delivery PRODUCT INFORMATION Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber is probably the most iconic of them all ! This saber is an hommage to the version we get to discover in Revenge of the Sith.  This is a saber replica, custom built with a tremendous precision and detail.  Like all of our amazing sabers, this hilt is made of aluminium 6063. Every saber boasts stunning finishes on a great build with strong materials to offer either the best reproduction of a legendary design or a very comfortable and yet stylish dueling weapon.   SABER CONFIGURATIONS Here's a simple breakdown of our available configurations. See our ""Which version to choose ?"" info box above for more details.  🥉Standard : the base model now with a Xeno 3 board, featuring rich sounds, lots of effects and customizable through a mobile app or via SD card. Standard sabers are baselit sabers with a lighter blade made for heavy dueling. Perfect if you plan on doing cosplay or stunt/duel performances or if you simply don't need the neopixel blade. 🥈Premium : it's our most wanted option! The same brand new Xeno 3 board but with a neopixel blade. The high density LED strip in the blade allows for an amazing look and tons of visual effects. Now customizable through a mobile app and, as usual, via the SD card. 🥇Deluxe : for the coders amongst you, completely customizable effects and styles thanks to the Proffie v2.2 board, here with one function button. There's no better neopixel lightsaber than this. If you like getting your hands dirty (mostly your keyboard) and mod the things around you to suit your needs, you'll love this !  DIMENSIONS 📐 Dimensions of the hilt : 28.3 cm / 11.2 inches in length, weighs approx. 520 g / 1.14 lbs 📐 Dimensions of the blade : choose between 72, 82, 92 cm (28, 32 or 36 inches) for the length. Blade format is 7/8"" instead of the standard 1"".  Polycarbonate thickness is 2mm for all 7/8"" blades. 📏 Recommended length of your lightsaber : a lot of academies and fencing federations request that the total length of your dueling saber stays between 100 and 110cm (39.4 to 43.4 inches). The blade usually sits inside the hilt for about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches). If you mean to use your saber in an official setting, be careful and choose the appropriate size, if you don't care for this, go for the longer blade length : 36 inches / 92 cm.    USABILITY CHART Key criterias for duelists is Handling and Weight, for cosplayers it is Style and ease of Maintenance, and for collectors it is mostly Style.     STYLE & REFINEMENT Little to no compromises made. For a screen accurate or exquisite lightsaber design.  5/5 HANDLING COMFORT Screen accuracy and complex design. This is a custom design replica not built for comfortable dueling use.  1/5 WEIGHT Replica and custom designs come with weight, feel solid, but will be heavy for sport use.  2/5 MAINTENANCE Accessibility and repairability of some elements may be complex. Charging the saber is rather simple.  2/5    If you have any questions about our sabers feel free to reach out to us through the chat, we speak english and french.  DETAILED SPECS WHAT'S IN THE BOX ?

The reason I would give it a 4.5 is that it requires you to switch out the top piece of the hilt in order to slot in the lightsaber, instead of unscrewing the top and just sliding the top over the inserted blade.

Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2023 Color: 2 Pack-black 15 ColorsVerified Purchase I was happy to find these. Not only was the deal worth it , on sale and $20 coupon off. But these are cool. I got this for my 9yr olds Xmas gift. For ""play"" but more for led design for the wall, since we are decorating it in Star wars theme. So I was nervous because their not cheap, and I was nervous about quality. But overall I'm pleased!! So the handle is heavy duty metal almost like a flash light. It's a nice sleek simple design. Everything is packaged nicely. The sound is realistic even the light flickers as you tap it for a realistic battle. I haven't tried all the colors but the blue shows up well the pink/red colors are a little faint in the light, probably needs to be a little dimmer for the saber light colors to be a little more vibrant. I am so excited for my son to open this up Christmas morning. I just hope he doesn't destroy it or Crack the stick part. Very happy with this purchase though!! Helpful Report 	janine spillman 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Size For Kids! Also Fun For Adults! Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2023 Color: 2 Pack-black 15 ColorsVerified Purchase  Is this going to be the most advanced light saber? No. But those will run you $300+ EACH. This product comes with TWO sabers and are of the same high quality as a $300 saber, just not as many functions. Specifically, these only come with two functions which would be FLASH ON CLASH (not very sensitive but OK) and STROBE LIGHT EFFECT (no sound). The sabers only come with TWO sounds which is the common START UP/TURN OFF and the IDLE SABER SOUND while on. These are obviously BASE LIT sabers, but the colors are all strong. At the tip, it's not perfect but it's OK. The reason why these sabers are just GREAT is that they are the ONLY 30"" sabers you will find which are perfect size for your children to duel with you! I would say age 4+ Think about it, you can't buy a full size 42"" light saber for a child. Even for adults, that's long!  You definitely won't be disappointed!

Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023 Color: 20 Colors BlackVerified Purchase Overall durable but the tip pops off fast… One person found this helpful Helpful Report 	willie the orca 5.0 out of 5 stars Light sabers Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2023 Color: 20 Colors BlackVerified Purchase The colors are great except the tip. The quality is about 8/10. The sound has a lot of issues when it turns on it sound terrific and when switching colors but when turning off and hitting it it's garbage...don't know how durability it is yet need to smack my lil bro a few times in the head for research.... Customer image 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report 	Juan Nanez 5.0 out of 5 stars Durable and sturdy Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2023 Color: 20 Colors BlackVerified Purchase  I love that these lightsabers have so many options to chose from. You can change the sound, the colors, and you can mute them as well. They are pretty easy to put together and your 2 y/o can learn how to use them. We had them for almost a year now and they still work flawlessly. He’s (and I, lol) loved his Christmas present all of this time, and we will use them for Halloween this year. Helpful Report 	Damien 3.0 out of 5 stars Great Hilt, Cheap Plastic Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023 Color: 20 Colors BlackVerified Purchase The hilt is excellent and works perfectly well. The colours are great, as are the other functions the saber has. The downside is that the plastic is not that great, and broke only after a few hits. The glue holding the tip is also not great, as it disintegrated and the tip kept flying off when I would swing.  Definitely think it's great value for the price, at least for the hilt. Just need to get different plastic for it is all. Customer image Helpful Report 	Dylan Myers 5.0 out of 5 stars Good quality for price. Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2023 Color: 2 Pack-black 15 ColorsVerified Purchase Was the coolest gift for my 4 yr old son. Now I can't stop him and his friends from wanting to sword fight whenever they get the idea. I hide it from them just to avoid having to make sure no one gets hurt. So far so good: the material is pretty safe and durable enough for light playfighting and the lights themselves are super cool, sound effects are decent. All around great fun. One person found this helpful Helpful Report 	Victor! 5.0 out of 5 stars Very durable, great for training with youglings Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023 Color: 15 Colors SilverVerified Purchase My daughters absolutely love these. Great battery life, the hilt is long enough for two handed. The sounds can be turned off (no fun in that); the cycle of colors is easy to do though note that it does not save your preference as you will need to cycle every time you power back on. The blade is very durable and does feel cheep at all; the length of the blade is a bit short for an adult but perfect for kids.  The double bladed option is fun.

Flimsy and fragile.  Hilt feels decent but the sound from impact seems to behave abnormally. Certain colours of lights are great.

Can be freely configured with a variety of light effect: percussion flash, sword, force, shooting light effect.  The feature worth mentioning is it supports to switch pixel saber to base lit version, that is, you can install our converter connector to convert the light saber lighted by the pixel pin to the light saber lighted by the LED.Of course, you also need to replace the pixel blade with a base lit blade The pixel blade is too heavy, and the internal led strip is at risk of being damaged under heavy dueling. Therefore, the design of this function can meet the customer's love of the pixel version function and the demand of the fighting function at the same time.  Product Information:  The size of the hilt is about 28cm,the length of the blade is 92cm in default.(you can leave a message to ask a other length blade under 92cm)  The XENO3.0 saber comes with a SD card but XRGB3.0 not,if you need you can choose the option including SD card.  INFORMATION FROM SELLER: 1.Bluetooth APP connection  It can be use to upgrad your saber, switch on and off the saber, change the color, adjust the volume, adjust the brightness and blade length, select the sound fonts and light effect, check the percentage of battery power, adjust the sensitivity, one key restore factory Settings and other configurations.  2.The saber comes with SD card or not  The XRGB3.0 version has 16 sets sound fonts and support SD card to add extra sound fonts,but the SD card is not included.If you need it you can choose the option XRGB3.0+SD card.  We preset 34 sets of sound fonts in the SD card.  XENO3.0 version comes with one SD card in the board,so if you choose XENO3.0 you don't need to buy it.  3.Pixel converts to RGB  Only XENO3.0 version supports this function.  If you have our XENO3.0 saber,you can convert it to RGB with our RGB converter and a base lit blade.  This feature is for the convenience of some players who need to fight at certain times.Obviously,base lit blades weigh less and don't have to worry about destroying the beads inside the pixel blades, making them better for heavy duels.

Very much like the ones I have seen in the movies. I turned it on and it lit up and had cool sound effects too. There are many colors you can cycle through. The colors are very vibrant. The battery lasts for a long time. It comes with a bracket to mount to the wall so you can display the light saber. Makes a great gift idea. Well made for the price. Highly Recommend.

Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023 Color: Black (2-pack)Verified Purchase  These are honestly fantastic! They are super well made, and actually feel like a quality product. When I was a kid I remember the lightsaber toys we're awful.  I mean I am 29 and writing a multiple point review on these because I am so surprised how great they are.  There is every shade you could imagine for the color. Theres a battery that you can change out, and the sabers are rechargeable. definitely great for cosplay and kids. I haven't had to charge them after a week of use.  The only con I can see (that might be a pro) is that if you try to duel someone else they will probably break over time. so don't wail on eachother. But the material is a very heavy plastic. Also you can live your darth maul fantasy by unscrewing the handle bottoms and connecting them. Happy sithing Read more Customer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer image 3 people found this helpful Helpful Report 	Kendra birchmeier 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2023 Color: Black (2-pack)Verified Purchase Love them, they are sturdy and have multi light combos. Comes with a charger and comes with a money back guarantee which takes the fear of breaking them away. Helpful Report 	Kremit DeFrog 4.0 out of 5 stars Does not have smooth swing Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022 Color: BlackVerified Purchase Got two of these for my nephews and my expectations were met fairly well for the most part. The blade length is shorter than I'd prefer for an adult lightsaber, but the blade length is perfect if I were to join the hilts to make a staff; a longer blade would make too long of a staff for me, but as a single lightsaber, I want a few more inches. The blade length is also perfect for the base lit LED. I think if there were any more length on the blade, you would be able to see fall off, but these were bright all the way to the tip. There were even some blade colors that flash and flicker! Which is something I was only expecting from a neopixel blade.  The base lit hilt is a sturdy aluminum handle and came charged ready to go; it even made a cool flashlight without the blade. The blades were exactly what I expected and durable enough they can duel (once I showed my younger nephew the proper speed to swing at). The only gripe I really have is the hilt does NOT have smooth swing as advertised, and just loops the saber sound regardless of your movements.  Pros: Blade is perfect length for base lit LED and doubling as a staff. Blade colors were more than I expected, including some flickering colors. These do have flash & clash, but not lock-up; again, as I was expecting/hoping for.  Cons: The base lit hilt is not strong enough to support a longer blade, and the blade is short for a full grown adult when used as a single saber. The swinging saber sound effect is on a loop and not actually governed by any smooth swing feature as advertised.  I'd rate this at 4½ stars, which is right where I found it after an average of 133 reviews. Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Report 	Chelle 5.0 out of 5 stars Good, basic saber. Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022 Color: Black (2-pack)Verified Purchase We purchased these for cosplay and twirling around. They light up well and the colors are even. The sound is pulsating while the saber is on and it makes a “clashing” sound when engaged with the other saber or an object. They aren’t terribly long in the blade but it’s ok and they fit together well for a saber staff. I exchanged the first ones I received because the sounds did not work properly on both sabers but the replacement came in good time and condition, no problems with the new ones. I like the simple handles because we are learning how to twirl them around. Also, they weren’t terribly expensive so if we launch them and they break …well…replacing them won’t hurt so much. 😆 Just don’t wack yourself with it lol. One person found this helpful Helpful Report 	Amazon Customer 3.0 out of 5 stars No impact sounds as described Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2023 Color: BlackVerified Purchase Overall product is decent but there is no sound on impact (or 3rd impact per instructions). The background sound is just a continual pulse not based on any movement. Helpful Report 	1234 5.0 out of 5 stars Great buy Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2023 Color: BlackVerified Purchase The lightsaber is quite sturdy and can be used for several hours on a single charge. Great toy for children. One person found this helpful Helpful Report 	AKay 1.0 out of 5 stars Eh. Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023 Color: BlackVerified Purchase It definitely came used. The box was ripped up and the tape was cut. The bottom of the hilt has a big open spot, cause it’s missing the bottom piece. The sound does do anything when you swing the light saber. Just makes the same constant sound. You have to hit it really hard to get it to make the clashing sound. Like, very hard. This is just not a good product. If you’re looking for a good light saber, this isn’t it. A toddler would be satisfied, cause they don’t know any better. This is garbage though. I want my money back. 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report See more reviews Top reviews from other countries Translate all reviews to English 	Amazon Customer 5.0 out of 5 stars Excelente Reviewed in Mexico on December 29, 2022 Color: BlackVerified Purchase Todo bien, en lo personal le falta sonido al moverlo, pero mi hijo es feliz y se ha divertido bastante, es mucho mejor que los ""oficiales"" de plástico en el mismo rango de precio Report Translate review to English 	Anita 3.0 out of 5 stars Most colors stopped working but some did Reviewed in India on July 30, 2023 Color: BlackVerified Purchase Many of my colors do not work and only 4 -5 colors work although originally they all worked but now they stopped does anyone know how to fix this 2 people found this helpful Report See more reviews Back to top Get to Know Us Careers Amazon Newsletter About Amazon Accessibility Sustainability Press Center Investor Relations Amazon Devices Amazon Science Make Money with Us Start Selling with Amazon Sell apps on Amazon Supply to Amazon Protect & Build Your Brand Become an Affiliate Become a Delivery Driver Start a Package Delivery Business Advertise Your Products Self-Publish with Us Host an Amazon Hub ›See More Ways to Make Money Amazon Payment Products Amazon Visa Amazon Store Card Amazon Secured Card Amazon Business Card Shop with Points Credit Card Marketplace Reload Your Balance Gift Cards Amazon Currency Converter Let Us Help You Your Account Your Orders Shipping Rates & Policies Amazon Prime Returns & Replacements Manage Your Content and Devices Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts Help   English United States Amazon Music Stream millions of songs		Amazon Ads Reach customers wherever they spend their time		6pm Score deals on fashion brands		AbeBooks Books, art & collectibles		ACX Audiobook Publishing Made Easy		Sell on Amazon Start a Selling Account		Amazon Business Everything For Your Business   Amazon Fresh Groceries & More Right To Your Door		AmazonGlobal Ship Orders Internationally		Home Services Experienced Pros Happiness Guarantee		Amazon Web Services Scalable Cloud Computing Services		Audible Listen to Books & Original Audio Performances		Box Office Mojo Find Movie Box Office Data		Goodreads Book reviews & recommendations   IMDb Movies, TV & Celebrities		IMDbPro Get Info Entertainment Professionals Need		Kindle Direct Publishing Indie Digital & Print Publishing Made Easy		Amazon Photos Unlimited Photo Storage Free With Prime		Prime Video Direct Video Distribution Made Easy		Shopbop Designer Fashion Brands		Amazon Warehouse Great Deals on Quality Used Products   Whole Foods Market America’s Healthiest Grocery Store		Woot!

Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2022 Color: Black1Verified Purchase  My family is a star war fan and hence we decided to get this for our toddler so that we can have some family fun time. Did not want to spend on the expensive ones and after searching on Amazon ended up with this. Overall it is fun to play and for the price, it is worth it to have one in the home. It is a fancy product and works as described. I would recommend this product overall.  My 2 cents are below:  Pros: - Fancy and intuitive lightsaber to use - My kid loves to play with it. Light and sound effects together keep him engaged - It is lightweight overall and my toddler is easily running with it in the home - 7 color options to change from & has inbuilt color changing modes - Battle mode is a nice feature in these and adds to the fun of playing with it - Has inbuilt rechargeable batteries that can give backup for up to 3 hours depending on how you use it - Manufacturer claims that it takes 3 hours to charge it completely & I found it correct in my experience - Sound is loud enough for a lightsaber - Convertible to dual-bladed lightsaber if you get two quantities of this product - The USB charging cable makes it versatile to power these through different methods - Good build quality overall - Comes in nice packaging making it a giftable option - Reasonably priced in the competition  Cons: - It has a proprietary DC charging port & not a USB-C as per the latest market standards - I wish there was some way to adjust the sound volume between low to high - I wish it had more realistic sound as Star wars Read more Customer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer imageCustomer image 10 people found this helpful Helpful Report 	D. Stanton 5.0 out of 5 stars Super bright, solid construction, held up well so far Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023 Color: Black1Verified Purchase My kids have half a dozen of the 'cheap' lightsabers...and this one just blows them away. It's super bright, and the light goes all the way up the saber from top to bottom with the same luminosity. It's also very sturdy/solid...and the battery seems to last a long while between charges. USB-C charging is nice too.  All in all, for the price point, it's awesome and has lasted a week of rough use with lots of battles. 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report 	Timothy 4.0 out of 5 stars Great Product! Though please read this review! Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022 Color: Black1Verified Purchase First and foremost great product. I read every review of this product and even YouTube a few videos to find out exactly what I’m paying for. However no reviews answered the questions I had so here is everything you need to know.  Pros:  -Sturdy, feels great with strong plastic blade durable enough that kids 6-12 would be able to have duels without breaking. And the hilt is even more durable. -The aluminum hilt feels amazing in my hand though for a rough reference, I wear a size small glove. So definitely meant for kids and smaller handed adults. - The lights on the blade are bright enough, though not nearly as good as the neopixle blade out there. But it is a budget saver after all. -Sounds are loud for my taste, but I just stuffed a cotton ball in the bottom of the hilt and now it’s just the right volume. -Has small holes drilled in the hilt to attach a string to keep the blade from flying out your hand. -All the Major light saber colors. -The blade is short enough that you can keep the hilt attached to your hip with the blade on with minimal issue if cosplay is your thing. Also I’m 5’9 with the hilt on my belt line the blade goes to about 5-6 inches off the ground if you’re looking to buy a costume with the robe to conceal the blade Now the cons: -Doesn’t sound like a lightsaber necessarily. The opening and closing noises are accurate enough for the price, and the hum of the blade idol is actually pretty accurate, but the swing of the blade definitely isn’t. -The blade is much shorter than an actual lightsaber, though I researched the company sells them at the actual length for about $100. - Not a standard charger, so try not to lose it!  Overall it’s great for a quick costume os cosplay is your thing or Halloween. Great toy for kids, and will last awhile. Though if you want a more accurate representation of a lightsaber youth on a have to spend the $100. But Satisfied with the purchase.

What a great weapon. Lights up very well, makes realistic sounds. Went to a Halloween party and was very impressed with it. Very durable Customer image Helpful Report 	Daniel 5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds aren’t the best but quality is amazing Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2023 Color: Black1Verified Purchase The sounds of lightsaber swinging is horrible so I try to just turn the sound off when I use it but at the price point you shouldn’t expect much. It is a great saber and I love the color changing mode Helpful Report See more reviews Top reviews from other countries 	Logan 4.0 out of 5 stars Great!

Good at the price but not for me , would suit more of a child as they wouldt notice.

Love this lightsaber! Great craftwork, it looks and sounds awesome! So glad SF made another lightsaber inspired by Bane's curved saber. I can't wait to get my next sabers, but I'm pretty sure this one will be my favorite for a while.    10 05/03/22 Tina Mezzell  So Disappointed! Hilt fell apart within minutes of receiving and customer service was even worse. They just stopped responding after the first email that said they would send return label. Never received label or any further correspondence after several tries? Very disappointed after waiting two months to receive, and then having to explain to my child that not all companies care about their customs or the products they sell.    2612 02/16/22 Bas Barneveld  Nice It is Very heavy with the blade instalt. It came a week to late. The built is very nice. Sound coult be a little louder. It is een beautyfull show piece.  To bad the gold one came out after my order. I'm thinking of getting en second one.   122 02/10/22 Anonymous  An Wonderful Saber. I like it. However,I had to pay a tax of $48,I think it's worth because the saber is really nice.The color of the saber is purple，It goes well with the black hilt.But I need an instruction sheet to understand the procedure of this.    60 01/17/22 Flying Dutchman Took a long time Love the saber but don’t believe Saberforge when is ways 15 weeks mine took 19 weeks.

DELIVERY & RETURN AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY TIMES Main factory (China) - High stock Made on order at factory : 20-25 days delivery PRODUCT INFORMATION Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber as seen in Star Wars : Revenge of the Sith.  This is a saber replica, custom built with a tremendous precision and detail, inspired by Obi-Wan's lightsaber design. The design is very similar to the one in Revenge of the Sith. Previously we had a black neck like in Clone Wars but from now on we ship the bronze neck design like in EpIII.  Like all of our amazing sabers, this hilt is made of aluminium 6063. Every saber boasts stunning finishes on a great build with strong materials to offer either the best reproduction of a legendary design or a very comfortable and yet stylish dueling weapon.  THIN NECK SABER WARNING : this lightsaber features a thin neck type of emitter. The blade sits very high and thus is not held as strongly as most sabers will hold a blade. We do not advise using this saber for dueling but more for cosplaying, twirling or showcasing.  SABER CONFIGURATIONS Here's a simple breakdown of our available configurations. See our ""Which version to choose ?"" info box above for more details.  🥉Standard : the base model now with a Xeno 3 board, featuring rich sounds, lots of effects and customizable through a mobile app or via SD card. Standard sabers are baselit sabers with a lighter blade made for heavy dueling. Perfect if you plan on doing cosplay or stunt/duel performances or if you simply don't need the neopixel blade. 🥈Premium : it's our most wanted option! The same brand new Xeno 3 board but with a neopixel blade. The high density LED strip in the blade allows for an amazing look and tons of visual effects. Now customizable through a mobile app and, as usual, via the SD card. 🥇Deluxe : for the coders amongst you, completely customizable effects and styles thanks to the Proffie v2.2 board, here with one function button. There's no better neopixel lightsaber than this. If you like getting your hands dirty (mostly your keyboard) and mod the things around you to suit your needs, you'll love this !  DIMENSIONS 📐 Dimensions of the hilt : 29.6 cm / 11.6 inches in length, weighs approx. 540 g / 1.19 lbs 📐 Dimensions of the blade : choose between 72, 82, 92 cm (28, 32 or 36 inches) for the length. SINCE NOVEMBER 2022 blade format is 7/8"" instead of the standard 1"".   Polycarbonate thickness is 2mm for all 7/8"" blades. 📏 Recommended length of your lightsaber : a lot of academies and fencing federations request that the total length of your dueling saber stays between 100 and 110cm (39.4 to 43.4 inches). The blade usually sits inside the hilt for about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches). If you mean to use your saber in an official setting, be careful and choose the appropriate size, if you don't care for this, go for the longer blade length : 36 inches / 92 cm.    USABILITY CHART Key criterias for duelists is Handling and Weight, for cosplayers it is Style and ease of Maintenance, and for collectors it is mostly Style.     STYLE & REFINEMENT Little to no compromises made. For a screen accurate or exquisite lightsaber design.  5/5 HANDLING COMFORT Screen accuracy and complex design. This is a custom design replica not built for comfortable dueling use.  1/5 WEIGHT Replica and custom designs come with weight, feel solid, but will be heavy for sport use.  2/5 MAINTENANCE Accessibility and repairability of some elements may be complex. Charging the saber is rather simple.  2/5    If you have any questions about our sabers feel free to reach out to us through the chat, we speak english and french.  DETAILED SPECS WHAT'S IN THE BOX ?

Now, this saber is awesome in its own right, but being a huge, Mass Effect fan, I am extremely excited. We’re finally able to get this released, because I’ve been sitting on that name and waiting to release a saber worthy of that name and anyone who knows anything about this saber design here knows where we got that name from and why the saber is definitely worthy of the name Spectre. But again, me myself, being a huge Mass Effect fan, I’m happy that we were finally able to release a saber that is worthy of the name Spectre. So, saber itself is again, of course, a very iconic design in the lightsaber universe. So, a lot of lightsaber fans would know where this design is derived from, but here at Ultra Sabers we decided to make this our own and I’m going to go over all the key features and options that make this an Ultra Saber. Of course, here at Ultra Sabers, we pride ourselves on offering tons of options and tons of ways that you guys can make this saber your own. So, start from the top we have to emitter here. Of course, we don’t have very many emitters with the guard, so we’re very happy we’re finally able to bring out a saber of this magnitude with a guard. So, this saber here has the guard on the emitter. You can get this emitter with or without windows. So, everyone knows what’s going to happen when I go ahead and press this button. We’re going to fire up the best and most versatile sound board on market you’ve seen sound board you can see here with the windows in the emitter look like. I’m gonna go ahead and give you a comparison, windows, emitter without the windows. So, with and without windows here. Without and with. So, again you can go for the flashier look with the windows or you can go for the more traditional look without the windows. Again, both are options on the Spectre. Turn that bad boy off because it is kind of loud. I want you guys to hear everything I’m saying. So again, with or without the windows in the emitter, you can go with the flashier look with the windows, which is what I prefer. If you want the more traditional look, you can get it without the windows. And moving on down, we have the activation box. We offer this in two different forms, as well. The angled and the squared. So, just depends on how you want to go with that. Similar to the Emperor’s Hand, which is a saber we released a little bit ago. You can get the angled box or the squared box. We’ve noticed that, I mean customers like both, so we decided to bring both to the Spectre, as well. We didn’t want to leave one behind so you can get either the angled look or the squared look on the Spectre. And then moving on down. So, one of the more exciting features in my opinion is the engraving on the body. I think this turned out fantastic. You can see the engraving here. So, if you go for the more flashy look, you can get the engraving, but of course, if you want to go more traditional, you can go ahead and get the Spectre without the engraving. So, I’m sure customers are going to enjoy both. So, we made sure we offered you guys both. With the engraving, a more traditional look without the engraving. So, moving on down, we have even more options, the pommel here. So you can get the pommel with a d-ring or without. Right here we’re looking at the pommel without the d-ring. You can also opt to get it with the D-ring. I’m gonna let the camera go ahead and focus in on this for you guys so you can see what the d-ring looks like. How it’s attached, how it hangs. So, if you opt for the d-ring, this is what you are in for. So, depending on how you want to wear this or just how you want it to look, you can opt to get the pommel with or without the D-Ring. So, every Spectre is going to come standard with the Covertec wheel. So, every Spectre is going to come standard with this Covertec wheel here and I also wanted to make sure in this video to show you guys, because I think it’s really cool how we did this on this saber, where the recharge port is.The recharge port goes right through the shroud, and this is the type of recharge port you will get if you opt for the recharge port, and as you can see the cutouts in the shroud go right around the recharge port, so it’s seamless. Nothing that was done after the fact. This was done at the time of machining, so if you opt for a recharge port, that’s your location, and this is how it will look on the Spectre, for those who are concerned with that. So, if you get a Recharge port, here’s your location, and here’s how it will look on the Spectre. So, moving on, there is one more option that I am very excited about and actually want to show you guys how this works. We’re offering the Covertec wheel in the emitter, so again the covertec wheel on the hilt comes standard, no additional charge, no option for it. Every Spectre is going to come with the covertec wheel in the hilt. Now, you want the covertec wheel in the emitter that is an additional option. So, I’ll show you what that is for. So, those that are familiar with this hilt, you know where we got this idea from, but the LED module is located here in the hilt. This screw actually holds the LED module in place, so you don’t have any concerns with that coming out, so long as that screw is tightened. So, if there are customers out there who may not think that that screws enough security, if you remove your emitter, my advice will be go ahead and get a pommel, a low-profile pommel, V4 pommel, or this is the Emperor’s Hand pommel, any pommel. You can go ahead and just cap off your hilt when the emitter is off. Prevent the LED module from going anywhere. Again, I don’t think that’s necessarily required, because this screw holds the LED module in place, but you want that additional security when you remove your emitter you can do that. So again, with the covertec wheel in the emitter you can wear the emitter and the hilt, so I think that’s pretty cool. The emitter itself is awesome looking and wearing it itself would attract a lot of attention and again, those who are familiar with this hilt model know where we got this idea from, so you can wear both the emitter and the hilt if you get the covertec wheel in the emitter. So that’s just one more nice feature with the Spectre and also the pommel itself is going to be available for sale standalone so you can get it on the your on any other saber or buy a standalone the pommel itself with the d-ring or without. So you guys can look for that, as well. So, I believe that covers all the features of the Spectre, again like I said at the beginning, this is easily my favorite addition to the Ultra Sabers family, and it’s not just because it’s new. It’s because the sabers awesome, I mean, it’s feature loaded, looks amazing, it’s a nice size, it’s a nice weight. Love the guard here, again I love all the features. I love the look of the emitter, all the way down to the body to the pommel. I just think that there’s no one part of the saber that stands out. I think it all holds its own weight. from the pommel the body to the admit er I think everything does holders all weight and it’s just a fantastic looking saber. So yeah if you guys have any questions about the Spectre go ahead and shoot us an email at info@ultrasabers or you can find us on live chat, as well, on the website. We’re always standing by to help you guys. Ultra Sabers is nothing without the support of it’s fans. You guys got us here and we’re going to continue to bring out amazing sabers like this and push the envelope so that you anyone with an Ultra Saber’s collection can be proud of that collection, and proud of the sabers that we’re releasing. That is our primary goal and we’re going to continue to push that goal. So again, shoot us an email if you have any questions. Catch us on live chat, and again, as always guys, thank you for watching and thank you for your support.    Ultrasabers Spectre  Ultrasabers Spectre Review Description Kanan Jarrus Lightsaber: Spectre Custom Lightsaber Ultrasabers is proud to present: Spectre  We’re extremely excited to present this one to you guys- it has immediately become one of our favorite lightsabers in the arsenal, and we’re sure you’ll agree.  Top to bottom, this lightsaber is packed with features that we’ve been itching to outfit a single saber with for a long time.  Say hello to one of the most beautiful emitters we’ve ever crowned an Ultrasaber with. The Spectre’s emitter rests atop the first rounded guard we’ve ever featured and is available with or without the beautiful wrap-around vertical windows for a look of pure elegance.  The emitter’s features don’t stop there. The Spectre is the first Ultrasaber that can be worn in two parts. We’ve designed the Spectre to accommodate a covertec wheel in the emitter so that it can hang from your belt independently of the hilt. If you recognize this lightsaber from it’s inspired source, you’ll understand why we’re so excited to be able to offer this feature, and why we worked so hard to make sure it was included.  You’ve undoubtedly already noticed the body of the Spectre. You all asked us to bring more lightsabers with etching to the lineup, and we weren’t about to hesitate to give you all what you ask for. The Spectre has been given the full-pattern treatment, with an intricate circuit board look that’s sure to turn some heads. For you purists out there: we haven’t forgotten about you! The Spectre’s body is available in a classic black anodized finish for that clean tuxedo look that you know and love from Ultrasabers. Finally, The Spectre comes standard with a covertec wheel that rests centered on the back of the shroud above the pommel.  You Ultrasabers veterans know that our features and options don’t stop there! We got such great feedback from all of you when we released our square and angled activation boxes, so we especially wanted to bring them back for The Spectre’s hilt to really complete the saber’s look.  And last, but definitely not least, we’ve capped off the Spectre with a great new pommel that really gives it the perfect balance you know we prioritize in a lightsaber crafted for expert combat. The Spectre’s pommel features four cardinal direction ridges that alternate with the position of the sound vents and really compliment the vertical etching that runs the length of the shroud. The Spectre’s pommel has been designed to accommodate a D-Ring for another option to be worn for cosplay (or any other night on the town).  The Spectre comes completely assembled and ready to go. The emitter and pommel are removable and compatible with MHS parts.

COLOR  Grey ELECTRONICS  Smooth Swing QUANTITY 1 −+ Buy now with ShopPay Buy with  More payment options The Fighter is the perfect first saber for those who don't want to spend a lot of credits but don't want to sacrifice quality.     The blade itself looks great but can also withstand some pretty heavy dueling. However, for your peace of mind, all our sabers come with a 365-day warranty, even for dueling damage!      All our saber blades can change to a plethora of colors and come with several built-in realistic sounds.      The Pixel option incorporates a strip of LEDs, allowing for a much brighter blade when compared to the base lit Smooth Swing version as well as more realistic effects.      The Smooth Swing function integrates changes in the volume and pitch of the blade, allowing for more realistic sound effects while dueling. While the Smooth Swing option has this feature, we have also integrated this function into the Pixel blades too.     This high-quality saber will make a fine addition to your collection and is available in a variety of options which you can find out more about down below.     If you have any more questions about saber specifications or anything else, feel free to ask!

DELIVERY & RETURN AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY TIMES Main factory (China) - High stock Made on order at factory : 20-25 days delivery PRODUCT INFORMATION Galen Marek's lightsaber hilt, as discovered in the video game The Force Unleashed 2.  This model features a custom leather wrap. As such we recommend this hilt for collection. Dueling use will wear and wrap will need to be replaced over time.  Like all of our amazing sabers, this hilt is made of aluminium 6063. Every saber boasts stunning finishes on a great build with strong materials to offer either the best reproduction of a legendary design or a very comfortable and yet stylish dueling weapon.   SABER CONFIGURATIONS Here's a simple breakdown of our available configurations. See our ""Which version to choose ?"" info box above for more details.  🥉Standard : the Xeno 3 Baselit option is not available. 🥈Premium : it's our most wanted option! The brand new Xeno 3 board but with a neopixel blade. The high density LED strip in the blade allows for an amazing look and tons of visual effects. Now customizable through a mobile app and, as usual, via the SD card. 🥇Deluxe : for the coders amongst you, completely customizable effects and styles thanks to the Proffie v2.2 board, here with one function button. There's no better neopixel lightsaber than this. If you like getting your hands dirty (mostly your keyboard) and mod the things around you to suit your needs, you'll love this !  DIMENSIONS 📐 Dimensions of the hilt : 31.5 cm / 12.4 inches in length 📐 Dimensions of the blade : it's our 1 inch diameter standard, then you choose between 72, 82, 92 cm (28, 32 or 36 inches) for the length. Polycarbonate thickness is 2mm for Standard sabers and 3mm for Premium and Deluxe sabers. 📏 Recommended length of your lightsaber : a lot of academies and fencing federations request that the total length of your dueling saber stays between 100 and 110cm (39.4 to 43.4 inches). The blade usually sits inside the hilt for about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches). If you mean to use your saber in an official setting, be careful and choose the appropriate size, if you don't care for this, go for the longer blade length : 36 inches / 92 cm.    USABILITY CHART Key criterias for duelists is Handling and Weight, for cosplayers it is Style and ease of Maintenance, and for collectors it is mostly Style.     STYLE & REFINEMENT Little to no compromises made. For a screen accurate or exquisite lightsaber design.  5/5 HANDLING COMFORT Screen accuracy and complex design. Some parts of this hilt may feel counter-intuitive in a dueling use.  2/5 WEIGHT Replica and custom designs come with weight, feel solid, but will be heavy for sport use.  2/5 MAINTENANCE Straightforward electronics core with easy to access charging port and components.  4/5    If you have any questions about our sabers feel free to reach out to us through the chat, we speak english and french.

I did receive both main saber first and free saber within the 1-2 weeks policy. I picked the Guardian because it looked sith like. It’s smooth in black finish and metallic feel on the uncoated/ Alloy parts; Coolest part is that I was able to combine both sabers into a staff 😝 but needs an actual adapter because the sound Fx gets muffled. Too bad I can’t show or allow more photos, words alone can’t justify how good these…  12/5/2023 Product review for Buy 1, Get 1 More FREE      Anthony Donovan  This is literally infinitely better than the saber I paid $270 for at Disney World  11/30/2023 You may also like Luke Skywalker [Replica] Luke Skywalker [Replica] Regular price$1,195 Sale price$547 Sale The Legionnaire The Legionnaire Regular price$395 Sale price$247 Sale 43915765547251|43915765580019 Leia Organa [Replica] Regular price$1,295 Sale price$647 Sale |14:29#Darts maul grays;200007763:201336100;977:200000312#RGB version|14:193#Darts maul silvers;200007763:201336100;977:200000312#RGB version|14:29#Darts maul grays;200007763:201336100;977:200000313#SN-pixel version|14:193#Darts maul silvers;200007763:201336100;977:200000313#SN-pixel version|14:29#Darts maul grays;200007763:201336100;977:200000314#Proffie with SD card|14:193#Darts maul silvers;200007763:201336100;977:200000314#Proffie with SD card Darth Maul [Replica] Regular price$995 Sale price$587 Sale 43915765252339|43915765285107|43915765317875 Ahsoka Tano [Replica] On sale from $587 Sale Join the SWA Sabers Team!

The two vents just below the primary blade are called quillons.   The Ren lightsaber features three long emitters making the saber durable, stable, and great for heavy combat. The hilt precisely crafted hilt creates a solid feeling in the wielder's hands. Made with the highest quality T6 Aircraft Aluminum hilt and a polycarbonate blade create the ultimate combination providing durability and efficiency.  Core Type Explanation Our lightsabers come with a choice of several cores: Baselit, SN Pixel, Xenopixel and Proffie. However, you can think about them as two major types: Baselit and Neopixel.  This choice affects how your saber will light-up, the available features, weight and durability.  The internal strip of LEDs in Neopixel sabers enables such an iconic effect as the gradual blade extraction from the lightsaber hilt. It looks like the light extends upwards from the hilt as if it was a real lightsaber.  The baselit sabers, as the name suggests, are illuminated by a single bright LED at the end tip of the hilt. This does enable the blade to still be bright and display multiple colors. It also makes the saber lighter and more durable for dueling purposes.  The more advanced electronics in the Neopixel ligtsabers makes them more expensive as compared to their baselit counterparts. But if you are looking for the most realistic look and feel the price difference is more than justified.  As we already mentioned, there are several types of Neopixel lightsabers available at our store: SN Pixel, Xenopixel and Proffie. Not all our sabers feature all of these choices.  These Neopixel cores differ from each other by their specific features or customization abilities. We have a detailed comparison table in the article on differences between neopixel and baselit sabers that can help you finalize your choice.   View more  FAQ               RGB V3 (a.k.a Baselit) w.

The blade is very durable and great for dueling. The hilt has a nice heft to it even without the blade inside, and even with the blade attached, it feels very comfortable and smooth to swing and perform tricks. It comes with an instruction card that tells you what specific taps and presses of the hilt's button can do and it can be a little tricky at first, but after a few seconds you'll get the hang of it. I have no complaints at all with this saber. $170 well spent.

DELIVERY & RETURN AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY TIMES Main factory (China) - High stock Made on order at factory : 20-25 days delivery PRODUCT INFORMATION The Colt is specifically designed for comfortable dueling use, and maintains great style. Another amazing choice for your lightsaber dueling collection.  The slotted emitter is a great design feature loved by many.  NOTE : this saber is not compatible with the VHC accessory standard. It is the same thread size as The Double and can only connect with this other saber or another The Colt.  Like all of our amazing sabers, this hilt is made of aluminium 6063. Every saber boasts stunning finishes on a great build with strong materials to offer either the best reproduction of a legendary design or a very comfortable and yet stylish dueling weapon.   SABER CONFIGURATIONS Here's a simple breakdown of our available configurations. See our ""Which version to choose ?"" info box above for more details.  🥉Standard : the base model now with a Xeno 3 board, featuring rich sounds, lots of effects and customizable through a mobile app or via SD card. Standard sabers are baselit sabers with a lighter blade made for heavy dueling. Perfect if you plan on doing cosplay or stunt/duel performances or if you simply don't need the neopixel blade. 🥈Premium : it's our most wanted option! The same brand new Xeno 3 board but with a neopixel blade. The high density LED strip in the blade allows for an amazing look and tons of visual effects. Now customizable through a mobile app and, as usual, via the SD card.  BLADE LENGTH 📐 Dimensions of the hilt : 26cm / 10.2 inches in length 📐 Dimensions of the blade : it's our 1 inch diameter standard, then you choose between 72, 82, 92 cm (28, 32 or 36 inches) for the length. Polycarbonate thickness is 2mm for Standard sabers and 3mm for Premium and Deluxe sabers. 📏 Recommended length of your lightsaber : a lot of academies and fencing federations request that the total length of your dueling saber stays between 100 and 110cm (39.4 to 43.4 inches). The blade usually sits inside the hilt for about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches). If you mean to use your saber in an official setting, be careful and choose the appropriate size, if you don't care for this, go for the longer blade length : 36 inches / 92 cm.    USABILITY CHART Key criterias for duelists is Handling and Weight, for cosplayers it is Style and ease of Maintenance, and for collectors it is mostly Style.     STYLE & REFINEMENT Some complexity is brought to a simple design. A good compromise for a dueling saber.  2/5 HANDLING COMFORT The ultimate dueling weapon : proper size, low weight and super ergonomic.  5/5 WEIGHT Super light hilt. Built for super fast spinning and saber wielding.  5/5 MAINTENANCE The easiest of sabers : in-hilt charging port and immediately accessible components.  5/5    If you have any questions about our sabers feel free to reach out to us through the chat, we speak english and french.

The colors are great and the smooth swing is perfect. With each sound font is a unique force push too. I do wish it had a few more sound fonts (like darksaber) the color white and maybe like 2 or 3 more blade flicker & fade settings but besides that great blade. Love it.  Judge.me YouTube video placeholder 00  Acolyte 01/13/23 Andrey  Great saber! Having lots of fun with my kid with 2 sabers. The only advise - buy staff coupler along if you’re buying 2 sabers to avoid the wait. You’ll buy it anyways :)  11  Acolyte 01/08/23 Anonymous  Acolyte Honestly love the hilt it looks great and feels super nice in my hand. I did manage to cute myself unscrewing the pommel and the tips for the emitter are pretty sharp as well. Other then that I have no complaints.  30  Acolyte 11/13/22 Rally Rivera  Worth the wait Much lighter than the cultist I bought previously. It feels great in my hand and has a nice weight to it without being too heavy  11 123 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     Back to top of page SHOP  Eco Sabers Apprentice Sabers Elite Sabers Crystal Sabers Exotic Sabers Gift Cards SUPPORT  Orders & Shipping Returns Military/Teachers/First Responders More COMPANY  Privacy Policy Terms of Service NEWSLETTER  Email address  Customers rate us 4.6/5 © 2023, SaberForge Not associated with DISNEY, LUCASFILM Ltd. or any Lightsaber franchise.Use left/right arrows to navigate the slideshow or swipe left/right if using a mobile device"

I didn't know the new Eco line had LGT cores. This is actually cool because I already own a bunch of LGT sabers and upgrading the cores will be easy. The old Eco line had 3 fonts and 1 color. This has nine fonts and infinite colors. The weathered hilt looks much better in person than it does in their display pics. I ordered it Sept 10th, 2021 and received it Sept 28th so it was a very quick turnaround. I may have to pick up more of these.  41  Acolyte Mk2 Eco 02/18/23 Faith Coleman  Amazing!

Only flaw I had was the covertech belt clip and the blades insertion. During spins and moves the hilt will slide and sometimes the covertech can be quite uncomfortable or painful however it is removable and optional so no issues there. The blade fits snuggly and nice inside the hilt but has a small amount of five which makes a small rattle between the hilt and the blade. I’m not sure if it’s meant to be that way but one bit of sticky tape on the side and it made it nice and snug but still very smooth to insert and take out. Over all it’s incredible  21  Acolyte Shoto 04/10/22 M.P.  Great First Saber My boyfriend has wanted a saber for a long time so I went for it and bought him this one. It’s high quality and it shipped quicker than I thought. My boyfriend was really happy with it and I’m happy with the order experience.  32  Acolyte Shoto 02/28/22 Ray  Present for my 5yr old It takes a few months to arrive, which they are clear about in the description. But when it arrived, it was better than expected. This is for my daughter, who now loves facing off against me and my Sinister Prophecy. As such, I did take a small file to the very tips, as they are very sharp. Otherwise, with the shorter blade, it is the perfect size/weight for her.  28  Acolyte Shoto 02/01/22 Lydia Johnston  Love it! I knew that the reviews for these sabers were generally good, but I was blown away by the quality!  30  Acolyte Shoto 10/22/21 Sir XenoSith  My 7-Year Old Son's First Hard-Core Saber My son was excited upon receiving it. It's been several months but because of the shape of the packaging he figured it out with one hint. He loves the feel of it and the color and sound. He is so happy that he has one in such detail as the one I have which I purchased over a year ago. He said now we can have some serious battles. Next person on the list is my wife. She needs one for herself. The $30 dollar sabers we have laying about the house does not compare to the quality and weight to them. Thank you for your existence.

The functionality and look of this is amazing! I’ve had other brands of lightsabers, but this one takes the cake for me. Especially, with the customizable features. I thought the RGB version would be dim compared to the pixel one I have, but I was wrong. It shines nearly as bright. Honestly, the only complaints I have are that the rectangular piece on the right of the button is very sharp (I’ve cut myself while testing the lightsaber’s swinging capability) and a few random scratches I spotted on the paint when I first opened it. But, that’s being nit-picky. Otherwise, I’ve got myself a perfectly beautiful and functional replica of Shaak Ti’s lightsaber. I couldn’t be happier.     20  Adamant 02/03/22 Peter  Small profile, big impact This hilt is perfect for wielding single handedly either as a primary or offhand blade. The details such as the knobs and brass rings around the emitter are very sexy. Hanging off your belt, there is no mistaking this for anything other than a lightsaber. I picked the single color electronics option with a green led. The blade color is absolutely blinding and the smooth-swing sounds are perfectly in synch with the motion of the blade. A perfect saber in both form and function.  50  Adamant 09/04/22 Julia Reid  Beautiful Product We ordered this Saber for my Son's birthday. Sadly the Adamant does not come with sound and we have to upgrade. Sending the Saber back was quite expensive on top of the upgrade fee to the Veteran, and then the upgraded 2-5 days shipping back to us via FedEx. Although Customer Service has been very helpful, I'm not sure why the building process takes three months, We ordered in May, received in August, sent it back in September and now we are waiting for the upgraded veteran model. $215.98 (Original Invoice (Adamant) + 117.37(Upgrade with Shipping) + 71.15 (UPS Shipping) = $404.50  24  Adamant 06/26/22 Anonymous  Great quality the only issue was the shipping but that is due to fedex  00  Adamant 05/27/22 David González  Outstanding Even if it's a little smaller than I expected, this lightsaber is a masterpiece. Not only you can see how thoughtful they were for recreating the details, you can also feel how much care and dedication was put together for bringing this magnificent lightsaber from the films to our hands.  02 123 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     Back to top of page SHOP  Eco Sabers Apprentice Sabers Elite Sabers Crystal Sabers Exotic Sabers Gift Cards SUPPORT  Orders & Shipping Returns Military/Teachers/First Responders More COMPANY  Privacy Policy Terms of Service NEWSLETTER  Email address  Customers rate us 4.6/5 © 2023, SaberForge Not associated with DISNEY, LUCASFILM Ltd. or any Lightsaber franchise.Use left/right arrows to navigate the slideshow or swipe left/right if using a mobile device"

The Aeon is super sleek and lightweight compared to my Prodigal Son I got several years ago. The electronics seem like they’ve upgraded since then too. I was specifically surprised at how smooth and variable the waving sound effects were, and now there’s MANY sound fonts to choose from to suit your jedi style.

The saber turns off and on easily once activated though. Very annoying when spinning and it accidentally cuts off. Sometimes it just rolls to its side and activates.

DELIVERY & RETURN AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY TIMES Main factory (China) - High stock Made on order at factory : 20-25 days delivery PRODUCT INFORMATION Revan's lightsaber, here in its Jedi version, is a beloved lightsaber for those who played the video game KOTOR.  This is a saber replica, custom built with a tremendous precision and detail. Contrary to our other Darth Revan lightsaber, this one is not advised for dueling (because of design of the hilt, not easy to duel with). But as a replica this one comes with our complimentary free case and stand.  Like all of our amazing sabers, this hilt is made of aluminium 6063. Every saber boasts stunning finishes on a great build with strong materials to offer either the best reproduction of a legendary design or a very comfortable and yet stylish dueling weapon.   SABER CONFIGURATIONS Here's a simple breakdown of our available configurations. See our ""Which version to choose ?"" info box above for more details.  🥉Standard : the base model now with a Xeno 3 board, featuring rich sounds, lots of effects and customizable through a mobile app or via SD card. Standard sabers are baselit sabers with a lighter blade made for heavy dueling. Perfect if you plan on doing cosplay or stunt/duel performances or if you simply don't need the neopixel blade. 🥈Premium : it's our most wanted option! The same brand new Xeno 3 board but with a neopixel blade. The high density LED strip in the blade allows for an amazing look and tons of visual effects. Now customizable through a mobile app and, as usual, via the SD card. 🥇Deluxe : for the coders amongst you, completely customizable effects and styles thanks to the Proffie v2.2 board, here with one function button.

Polycarbonate thickness is 2mm for Standard sabers and 3mm for Premium and Deluxe sabers. 📏 Recommended length of your lightsaber : a lot of academies and fencing federations request that the total length of your dueling saber stays between 100 and 110cm (39.4 to 43.4 inches). The blade usually sits inside the hilt for about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches). If you mean to use your saber in an official setting, be careful and choose the appropriate size, if you don't care for this, go for the longer blade length : 36 inches / 92 cm.    USABILITY CHART Key criterias for duelists is Handling and Weight, for cosplayers it is Style and ease of Maintenance, and for collectors it is mostly Style.

THIN NECK SABER WARNING : this lightsaber features a thin neck type of emitter. The blade sits very high and thus is not held as strongly as most sabers will hold a blade. We do not advise using this saber for dueling but more for cosplaying, twirling or showcasing.  SABER CONFIGURATIONS Here's a simple breakdown of our available configurations. See our ""Which version to choose ?"" info box above for more details.  🥉Standard : the base model now with a Xeno 3 board, featuring rich sounds, lots of effects and customizable through a mobile app or via SD card. Standard sabers are baselit sabers with a lighter blade made for heavy dueling. Perfect if you plan on doing cosplay or stunt/duel performances or if you simply don't need the neopixel blade. 🥈Premium : it's our most wanted option! The same brand new Xeno 3 board but with a neopixel blade. The high density LED strip in the blade allows for an amazing look and tons of visual effects. Now customizable through a mobile app and, as usual, via the SD card. 🥇Deluxe : for the coders amongst you, completely customizable effects and styles thanks to the Proffie v2.2 board, here with one function button. There's no better neopixel lightsaber than this. If you like getting your hands dirty (mostly your keyboard) and mod the things around you to suit your needs, you'll love this !  DIMENSIONS 📐 Dimensions of the hilt : 28cm / 11 inches in length  📐 Dimensions of the blade : it's our 1 inch diameter standard, then you choose between 72, 82, 92 cm (28, 32 or 36 inches) for the length. Polycarbonate thickness is 2mm for Standard sabers and 3mm for Premium and Deluxe sabers. 📏 Recommended length of your lightsaber : a lot of academies and fencing federations request that the total length of your dueling saber stays between 100 and 110cm (39.4 to 43.4 inches). The blade usually sits inside the hilt for about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches). If you mean to use your saber in an official setting, be careful and choose the appropriate size, if you don't care for this, go for the longer blade length : 36 inches / 92 cm.    USABILITY CHART Key criterias for duelists is Handling and Weight, for cosplayers it is Style and ease of Maintenance, and for collectors it is mostly Style.     STYLE & REFINEMENT Little to no compromises made. For a screen accurate or exquisite lightsaber design.  5/5 HANDLING COMFORT Screen accuracy and complex design. This is a custom design replica not built for comfortable dueling use.  1/5 WEIGHT Replica and custom designs come with weight, feel solid, but will be heavy for sport use.  2/5 MAINTENANCE Reaching the battery and the board requires some disassembling of the hilt.

The feature worth mentioning is it supports to switch pixel saber to base lit version, that is, you can install our converter connector to convert the light saber lighted by the pixel pin to the light saber lighted by the LED.Of course, you also need to replace the pixel blade with a base lit blade The pixel blade is too heavy, and the internal led strip is at risk of being damaged under heavy dueling.
