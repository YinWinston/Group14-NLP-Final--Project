Great charger a month ago Super price on magnetic phone charger for iPhone 13. Works great for a price I couldn’t refuse. Helpful? (0) (0) Report  Mike VERIFIED PURCHASER Review 1 Votes 0 4 out of 5 stars. I like it. a month ago Does exactly what it's supposed to do — charge my phone and ear buds. It's not high-powered enough to charge my wife's Apple phone though. So it's fine for me. About the only thing I don't like is that it has a red light in one corner that stays on whenever the pad is plugged in. The light changes from red to blue when you put a device on it and its in ""charging"" mode. But I wish the red light wasn't on constantly when I don't have anything charging on the pad. That's it though, the only downside to this particular charger. There's no point in that red light being on all day and all night long. A light should come on maybe WHILE something is charging, but not when NOT charging, which is like 95% of the time. Overall, I am satisfied with it. Got it for a VERY good price from Verizon.

Rapid charging capabilities 9 months ago Pros: This cord provides fast, powerful charging capabilities for supported devices. In my experience, it exceeds the output of conventional wall-wart style bricks, including that of my standard ""brand""-book charger, while including the peace of mind and safety of overcharge protection. There are built-in hook-and-loop ties for convenient cable management on the go, as well as bend protection. Cons: It could be a bit longer. At nearly 8 inches shorter than the charger that came with my ""brand""-book laptop, that is noticeable, especially when the device is in use while being charged. That shortcoming limits freedom of movement and placement, but that isn't a dealbreaker for me. It's still my favorite. If there is a longer cord available that is rated for use with this charging brick, I'd be interested in picking one up. This aspect is the only downside. Everything else about this charger is lovely. Yes, I recommend this product. Helpful?

Excellent charger for my MacBook Air 2 years ago This is a great charger for our MacBook Air, which is the latest model with the Apple M1 chip. It has a sturdy and high-quality feel to it, was immediately recognized by the laptop, and did not heat up at all. I especially appreciate the latter, as third party charges we have purchased in the past got very warm (enough to make me worried about it!). I am not surprised, as Targus is a very good name that I have come to trust. Yes, I recommend this product. Helpful?

Fast and reliable Charger 2 years ago I use this charger/ ac adapter on my new Macbook Air (M1 Chip) and it does the job nicely. I can get a full charge in less than two hours and am good to go. It doesn't seem to overheat like a lot of after market chargers will. My main complaint would be the general design. It is like your typical AC adapter (though perhaps a bit smaller) whereas I am used to what Apple provides. Apple provides a sleek, one cable charger that plugs direct into the wall with the USB-C cable running to the laptop. This is your standard design with the AC unit running one cable to the wall and the USB-C cable to the laptop, leaving the awkward, clunky unit dangling somewhere in between. This is only a minor complaint since this is pretty much a standard design, but having gotten used to my Apple charger, this a lot less streamlined. It isn't much of an issue as I am using it as a permanent charger plugged into my home office. I really would prefer not to use this as my portable charger as it is just too many cables to haul around compared to Apple's. Still, it is good quality. Yes, I recommend this product. Helpful?

This charger is great to leave at my house and wired into my desk. That way I can keep one at home and one in my bag. I have experienced no issues and it charges quickly while also looking sleek. The big part of the charger is in the middle of the cord instead of attached to the part where you plug it into the wall which I find better. Yes, I recommend this product. Helpful?

HP 65W Slim adapter 8 months ago This product seems to have been designed to use with the most notebook models possible. At the very end of the power cord, you can connect any of three fittings (depending on the notebook model) which plugs directly into the notebook. My problem is that the attachment does not stay connected to the power cord. The attachment falls off of the power cord very easily, leaving you with the attachment remaining in the notebook while the power cord remains on your desk or is dangling in midair. Hence, you need to keep a close watch on your notebook to be sure that it is getting power and/or charging. No, I do not recommend this product. Helpful?

Doesn't charge either of two HP Spectres 3 months ago It doesn't charge reliably, at all. Does charge either of my two HP Spectres. Their original charges work fine. It's a shame that an HP $100 charger doesn't work for HP products. Apparently, other GaN chargers lack compatibility as well (Google it). It's rooted in an issue with HP, Bios, hardware, or something similar. I returned this for a refund. No, I do not recommend this product. Helpful?

CliffG · 3 months ago   Universal Power Supply needed a power supply for my cable box. ATT would not help since it is an old box and they are ATT.. Matched the output voltage and amperage and with the wide selection of plugs was able to find a match. Works just fine. Was alittle more than I'd hoped to pay, but needed it.  Helpful?

It understands me, it listens to me, it is patient it is kind. This AC adapter gets me. I don't even look at other AC adapters now.

I originally purchased it Valentine's Day weekend . I have had to take it back twice to get another one. It's the same problem all the time. The small piece does not want to work for some reason. There is power going to the charger due to the whitish light glowing but no power past that point.

Tim88 · 6 months ago   Misleading Claims of 5v Output This device will not output 5V power to the universal tip. Nothing on the packaging or in the instruction manual mentions this limitation. All marketing materials claim universal output including 12v, 9v, 7.5v, 6v, 5v, 4.5v, and 3.v, but when you set the switch to 5V there is no power at all coming out of the universal plug. All other voltage settings provide power, but 5v does not. If you aren't trying to use it for 5v it seems like it'd work fine, however if you are looking for 5v it's a waste of money and time.
