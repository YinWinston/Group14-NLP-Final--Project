The door shattered less than a year later md1999 a month ago We purchased this oven in July 2022 from a store, and had it finally delivered in November that year. Yes, it took that long for this company to supply. In the middle of September 2023, during the first self cleaning cycle, the glass door shattered and broke inside the oven. I contacted their customer service and they put in a request to have the door replaced, but because they’re having supply issues, a part couldn’t be found. So they agreed to replace my unit with a new one of the same model. They tried to deliver the microwave, the wrong unit, so I had to reject that delivery, contact them again, send proof I hadn’t accepted because on their end it looked like they had done the job. It’s November 1 2023 and I’m still waiting for the new oven, which supposedly was going to be delivered today but they had to reschedule to an unknown future day because their truck had problems. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. I will never EVER buy another Cafe or GE product as long as I live, and I’ll make sure I discourage anyone I can from purchasing from this company. I emailed to ask for a refund, but they can’t because I already agreed to a replacement and the order for one is floating in the system. I urge you all to stay away from these overpriced products, they’re absolutely not worth the hype and look. No, I do not recommend this product. Helpful?

(0)  (0) report Q: Help me understand why CTS90DM2NS is not supposed be installed below cooktop (specifically CHP90301TBB induction) when other Platinum Glass model CTS70DM2NS5 appears to not have that restriction. No electrical differences? What is concern or issue? danm_ks 3 months ago 1 Answer ANSWER THIS QUESTION A: Hello,  Thank you for taking out some time to connect and share your question. We're more than happy to go over this.  The reason that model CTS90DM2NS5 can't be installed under CHP90301TBB, is due to the way the electronics and heat output is setup. It can interfere with the cooktop and generally cause overheating. We recommend checking out this link for all of our approved combinations. Here is the link: (https://products-salsify.geappliances.com/image/upload/s--SbA47AKX--/1805926dc23de75af408fdc88702040eb7c8670e.pdf?).

The first is a six burner and one griddle gas cooktop which I have had for a year and a half and I love it so I went with a platinum double wall oven.

While I haven't had it long enough to tell you about its reliability. If it works like my cooktop, it's another five stars.

(2)  (0) report Q: What is the temperature during self cleaning? katrp a year ago 1 Answer ANSWER THIS QUESTION A: Greetings! We appreciate you connecting with us. This is a great question, and we are happy to assist.  We do not share the operating temperature of the Self-Clean feature for competitive reasons. Self- Clean uses high temperatures to burn off oven soils. A small amount of smoke may escape from the oven during the Self-Clean cycle. This is because the soil in the oven is being burned off and turned into ash. A small amount of smoke is considered normal. It can take between 30 and 90 minutes for the oven to cool down after a Self-Clean cycle. The lock light and/or clean light may remain on during this time. White ash on the oven interior after the Self-Clean cycle is normal. Food soil can leave ash deposits in the oven after it has burned off. This appears as a light film or a darker, heavier ash, depending upon the amount of soil which was in the oven. This ash can be removed with a water and vinegar solution using a sponge or cloth.

We are sorry to hear that the screen keeps freezing when you use the steam feature, and will not function until you reset the breaker. This is certainly not normal operation, nor the quality that we expect. We recommend taking advantage of the manufacturers warranty, and schedule an appointment with our factory service team by calling 1-800-432-2737, or by scheduling online at the following link: https://www.geappliances.com/ge/service-and-support/service.ht Thank you for your review! -Devin@Café Appearance Appearance, 5.0 out of 5 5.0 Features Features, 5.0 out of 5 5.0 Performance Performance, 1.0 out of 5 1.0 Quality Quality, 3.0 out of 5 3.0 Value Value, 3.0 out of 5 3.0 1 out of 5 stars. DO NOT BUY UNLESS DEAF anonymous 2 months ago I have never rated anything one star in my life. I am horrified with what I purchased, and the money we have wasted. I was very excited initially with the steam oven, it looks beautiful, comes with a temperature probe. Fits nicely into our beautiful, walnut custom cabinetry above the standard electric convection oven also from Café. I have attempted to upload the video of how noisy this appliance is, however, I am unable to upload video or photo. The steam reheat feature does not work, instead, it drips while making a noise so loud that a dinner party would stop talking. When the cooking feature is done, the discharge requirement takes two minutes and produces an even louder noise. It is not heating or steaming correctly, I made tamales yesterday, and it took 50% longer to cook than intended. I am most disappointed that we will have to redo the cabinetry to fit in an appliance that actually works. The cost of redoing the built-in cabinetry that houses this worthless product is going to far exceed the initial cost of the steam oven. DO NOT BUY. I hope someone reads this review. Unfortunately, I trusted our kitchen designer that this was a great product, this product is awful. No, I do not recommend this product. Helpful?

I like the two smaller-than-typical ovens that take up the same footprint as our previous wall oven. We found the install a little tricky due to the depth of this unit, but managed to get it in the original space. I think it would be great if it came in the other finishes offered in the Café line.

NONE BETTER FOR THE PRICE AND FEATURES cooklikeaboss 13 days ago For once, I had the financial wherewithal to pick any double oven I wanted - and even though there was a modest discount from GE if I replaced the existing GE unit with them, I decided to just pick the best fit for my COOK LIKE A BOSS home kitchen - it's where I test recipes before I teach the COOK LIKE A BOSS DETROIT lessons. After testing out the new wave of oven racks, and all brands high and low, the GE Cafe model did way more than even higher priced brands did. These ovens have much sturdier slide-out oven racks than any other - not only does the top oven have 2, the bottom oven has one. BOTH ovens are convection, and both have that all-important probe. GE is one of very few companies that also have DEHYDRATION; of course that have air frying; just about all ovens do. The smart of it all is the best - being able to use the camera (top oven only) and control both ovens through the SmartHQ app is a real game-changer. This is a feature-packed unit for a really incredible price and outstanding form and connectivity. Yes, I recommend this product. Helpful?

We're more than happy to help clear this up.  Since this model is designed to be used with our self-clean roller racks we wouldn't recommend switching them to flat racks.

I love the look of this toaster. love the look though 10 days ago 1 Answer ANSWER THIS QUESTION A: Thank you so for choosing Café Appliances for your home we are honored you chose us! Lets talk about smells. Smells from your toaster are normal. We recommend when you get your unit up and ready to use to Set the browning level to maximum (8). Operate the appliance empty, to cure the new elements. This may smell a bit, but it’s nothing to worry about. This should help with the odor once everything it cured.   Please reach out if you have any questions. ~ Lisa@CaféAppliances lisar1 7 days ago Helpful?

I got a dud of a machine jwd kitchen 5 days ago I purchased this machine based on reviews end of 2021, with renovations did not move in until a year later. After using it maximum 15 times, the Empty Waste light is constantly on and machine will not work. I called but out of 1 year warranty with little help other than manual to clean which I did several times and followed the steps. Very sad with the lack of customer support on a machine that I used less than 15 times, as I put in all new GE CAFE in my recently 2022 renovated kitchen.

I love it! anonymous 8 days ago I absolutely love my espresso machine!! It took me a few tries to get the perfect grind size and milk froth but it is great. Tamping and frothing are not automatic so you do have to understand a bit about the espresso making process and how to froth milk but I love being able to do it myself because I can create it exactly how I like it and manually modify it. My mom has a Breville espresso machine that froths milk automatically and has the ability to customize temperature and foam amount but I have found that, when I use this machine, the milk isn’t as creamy as I would like for it to be. Fortunately, I can manually froth milk with my Cafe espresso machine so I can customize it exactly how I want it. At first, I had to play around with the grind size to make sure that the portafilter didn’t overflow and that the grounds were large enough for water to flow through without puddles remaining in the top but it was not difficult. I have a good understanding of espresso machines from working at a coffee shop but reading the manual really helped me understand it even better (so definitely read the manual for tips and tricks on grinding beans and frothing milk). It does offer the ability to connect with your phone via WiFi to create a customizable drink but I have not yet explored this feature so I don’t have much information to share regarding that. Overall, this espresso machine has been wonderful. Plus, it is the most aesthetically pleasing machine I have found and makes a great addition to my kitchen! Yes, I recommend this product. Helpful?

The manual doesn’t specify. fariborz 16 days ago 1 Answer ANSWER THIS QUESTION A: Hello there- Thank you for reaching out today. If grinder is not working properly and the light flashes purple, this means the grinder is getting clogged/jammed and/or the rotor is locked. You will need to clear out the grinds completely then clean the grinder following the instructions in the manual. The grind size may be set too fine. We recommend setting the grind setting between 7 and 9 and use non-oily medium roast beans for the best espresso. We hope this help. Please let us know if we can help with anything else.

The owners manual does not state the different error modes concisely. I was having troubles with blinking a single and double buttons but can't find it anywhere. mikeyg 28 days ago 1 Answer ANSWER THIS QUESTION A: Hello, hope you are doing well. The model you noted does have some LED buttons flash to indicate ca variety of things. For example, the power button flashes when the unit is ready, the grinder button will flash red when the grinder is blocked and needs attention, white grinder button illuminated means it has been running and needs time to cool down before next use, if all buttons are flashing that means too much pressure the grounds are packed to tight and needs to be adjusted. These are some of the LED light notifications. Below is the link to the manual. Please click on link, then hit the control and F keys on your keyboard. If you type flash in the finder box it will show you all the times flash is mentioned in the manual and explain each one.   https://products-salsify.geappliances.com/image/upload/s--tp6vh1RK--/tn4tg65gc5z2vj26orug.pdf?_ga=2.99124510.1009899439.1700054711-1654627661.1698410882  Hope this helps clarify things, if you need further assistance please don't hesitate to reach back out to us. ~ Lisa@CaféAppliances lisar1 27 days ago Helpful?

We use this all the time to make a quick latte, and the My-Cup feature is great for my Lungo. I love that it self cleans before use, so you know that it'll be a fresh cup. If I had to nit-pick I wish I had more ability for adjustment; the app only allows a handful of settings. Helpful?

This unit is not expected to have any build up of ice during use. The dual-drawer refrigerator defrosts automatically. The water on back wall drains into the water tank and is evaporated by the condenser. If there is a build up occurring, this would be caused by either the door not closing properly, or the unit has a defect in the gasket preventing the doors sealing properly when closed.

SHould I ""cure"" the piece before use? emiliano 10 months ago 1 Answer ANSWER THIS QUESTION A: Greetings.   Thanks so much for checking with us. This griddle/grill is made of cast iron and not non-stick aluminum. We would suggest to care for this accessory as you would a cast iron skillet. Below, we will list a few tips to help.   Care and Cleaning Instructions: Before first use, rinse with hot water and dry thoroughly. Do not clean the griddle in a dishwasher. Do not place the griddle in a microwave oven.  To clean your griddle: Rinse with hot water, scrub with a sponge, and towel dry. After each use, apply a very thin layer of oil to the surface to maintain the seasoning.  CAUTION: Do not use abrasive materials (such as steel wool) or harsh detergents to clean your griddle. CAUTION: Pooled water on your griddle or letting the griddle air dry can cause it to rust. Remember to towel dry and maintain proper seasoning.   If your griddle does rust: Remove the rust with steel wool. Re-season the area or the entire griddle with the method below. If something has spilled under the griddle, it should be cleaned up as soon as possible to prevent “baked on” food soil. Do not allow grease to accumulate under the griddle. Clean under the griddle with hot, soapy water as soon as it is cool.  Re-seasoning Instructions: 1. Clean the surface of the griddle by removing as much of the seasoning as possible. 2. Heat your oven to 350F. 3. Coat the griddle with a thin layer of oil and place it in the oven for one hour. 4. Allow the griddle to cool and repeat as necessary to restore the seasoning.  We hope this information helps! You are greatly appreciated for thinking of Cafe when it comes to your kitchen's needs. Please feel free to connect with us at any time. Happy cooking to you! -Haley@Café haleycafe 10 months ago Helpful?

Broke sitting one week
We had our drier for exactly one week before the “little belt” holding the drum snapped. Although still under warranty as the machine was brand new, it took nearly 2 weeks to schedule a service appointment. Making matters worse the technician did not have a replacement belt in stock which is now nearly 2 weeks on back order so have needed to line dry our clothes for over a month so far and still counting!

F & P condensing dryer
Dismayed at first. After figuring out how I'd use it's feature(s) to fit my needs, I like it. The auto sensing feature is what was disappointing to me at first and now still, I think it could use some improvement. Many of the drying cycles default to the autosensing feature. The display only shows what seems to spell out AUTO the entire life of the cycle. It will not count down. Why not include a countdown /timer while using auto sensing? If the sensors 'guesstimate' the loads drying time, why not display that countdown, instead you are playing a waiting game of when the sensors feel the clothes are dry. I'd rather see a count down displayed then a partial spelling of AUTO on the screen when using the dryer. There are something like 13 drying cycles listed on the knob and 9 default to auto sensing. I've used a few, but always go back to Everyday and Extra Dry and my clothes are always dry. If I don't choose Extra Dry, and choose Dry, they are very slightly damp at the end of the cycle, and for me I will have chosen that on purpose for clothes that I want to get out, shake out wrinkles and then hang and they basically finish drying within minutes. I only do this when I'm doing loads of work clothes/ blouses/ dress pants etc. I chose a condensing dryer because I do not have outside ventilation, I also have very limited space for my machines and these fit the bill for my requirements. I love that I do not have to empty a tank of water from the dryer, because it empties directly from it's hose to the stand pipe in rear of machine. I had a perfect install by ABT.

If I don't choose Extra Dry, and choose Dry, they are very slightly damp at the end of the cycle, and for me I will have chosen that on purpose for clothes that I want to get out, shake out wrinkles and then hang and they basically finish drying within minutes. I only do this when I'm doing loads of work clothes/ blouses/ dress pants etc. I chose a condensing dryer because I do not have outside ventilation, I also have very limited space for my machines and these fit the bill for my requirements. I love that I do not have to empty a tank of water from the dryer, because it empties directly from it's hose to the stand pipe in rear of machine. I had a perfect install by ABT.

SeattleHawaii · 7 months ago   2nd F&P Double DishDrawer great upgrade. We bought a condo that had a F&P double dishdrawer that we used for 13 years. I replaced it with the new F&P, Tall that provided an excellent upgrade. The taller top drawer allows me to place some plates that didn't fit in the older version. The new version allows adjustments of the racks. We needed to continue with a drawer version because of spacing issues. With the drawer open we can still pass by to move to another area. More traditional dishwashers door is too big when opened and would cut off an access area. It's easy to reach into the drawers for loading and unloading. It's super quiet. We're very happy with our purchase.  Design Design, 5 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.

This is the second Double Dishdrawer we have had, the first was in the kitchen when we moved in and we really liked it so we got another one. This one has a totally stainless steel interior except for the basket parts which is why I went for it. It's very quiet too. I could have probably fixed the first one easily again but it's almost 20 years old and it was time, but I will probably look at fixing it anyway for use somewhere else.

Kimbo · 2 years ago   Amazing Dishwasher This is our second Fisher Paykel double drawer dishwasher from your company and I would never put a single drawer dishwasher in my house again the Convenience of having two drawers to fill is amazing one for nighttime dishes and one for morning dishes which is superb! The only thing I would suggest for this new model that's different from the old model is that you have a light or a display that either changes colors when it is clean or a display that says it's clean so that way someone doesn't open up the clean drawer and put dirty dishes inside of it. The older models had an indication method that helped with that issue.Other than that we Love the design and also how quiet it is.

It’s so good to have the FIsher & Paykel Dish drawers again! We’ve owned this model in two previous homes, and I am THRILLED to have it back! We’ve purchased this model three times; two times in new construction homes that we sold after living in for 2 years. Our current home had a dishwasher that stopped working and I immediately knew what I was replacing it with! I could recall that I loved this dishwasher from my previous experiences, but I forgot how much I loved it until I got it back! You will not be disappointed! Runs quiet, dries well, sanitizes, easy to load/ unload, and it’s beautiful! I also love that you can run a small load on not feel guilty because you didn’t fill a whole dishwasher.

Extremely disappointed with this unit. It is my third Fisher Paykel dishwasher and it is not nearly as efficient as my 2 prior units. It doesn’t clean well, it does not get hot enough and uses more energy and water than the previous models. The repair men explained that the new model has an extremely small heating element compared to the older models which means you need to run the hot water before using and run longer cycles. SO MUCH FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WATER CONSERVATION! Shame on Plessers Appliance for not explaining the changes in these dishwashers.

Jane · a month ago   Racks not well arranged Fisher & Paykel is my favorite brand of dish drawer. We had one for 21 years, and finally had to replace it because one dish drawer broke down. The other still worked. Anyhow the new dishdrawer features a modified arrangement for the dishes which actually makes the space less usable than with the old one. The simplicity of the old racks was much easier to use. Otherwise the machine is quiet and gets the dishes very clean.  fisherpaykel.com/ca	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/ca Design Design, 3 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    Response from Global Customer Support Centre: · a month ago   Thank you for sharing your feedback, both positive and constructive.

I found that one of the DishDrawers most often handled a full days dishes for our family of four...this made me happy. I recently retired, moved into a new home and the first thing I did was purchase a Fisher & Paykel Double DishDrawer Dishwasher. This is the third one for me. I see there are other brands now available however I have never had any issues with my Fisher & Paykel brand and will continue to stay with this brand for any future purchases. For those of you with smaller families who do not like dirty dishes sitting around give this a try...you will fall in love like it did. It is well worth it.  * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆1 out of 5 stars.	Rayb · a year ago   Error codes and incomplete cycles after a week. Our dishwasher was awesome for about 12 cycles... Fault codes and incomplete cycles started, its been looked at twice with no real resolution. Unfortunately its in a vacation home and waiting on parts that may solve the problem, we wont know until April. Disappointing for what is deemed and priced as a high-end product.

I purchased two of these dishwashers & they are expensive. I am not happy with either one of them. Neither of them dry the dishes & both units are wet inside even after choosing ""EXTRA DRY"". They require ""Powder Detergent"" & it never empties properly out of the tray. If you use liquid detergent, it is all over the inside of get door after going through the entire cycle. I use the rinse aid & it does not help with the drying at all in these units. The silverware does not get clean whatsoever and the dishes need to be washed before being placed in the dishwasher or they will not be clean. I am so disappointed. It is not the case that I possibly got a lemon as I have two different machines having the same issues. If I could return these units, I most certainly would do so. The techs I have spoke with do not even want to service these units due to so many problems, not being able to get parts, poor customer service, etc. I am still waiting for my panel replacement from the beginning of November as they sent the wrong one with the handle - it will be January at the soonest before I get it. I wish I would have looked into the reviews further and made a better decision.

Paul C · a year ago   Good features. Good space. Good space inside. The wide-open arrangement of shelves accomodates all our container shapes and sizes. I like that the ice maker empties into an accessible container in the bottom freezer - last fridge, different brand, had a mechanical ice dispenser in the door of fridge that kept icing over and blocking up the whole feeder mechanism; and its ice feeder took up a lot of room in the fridge section. I chose this particular F&P model because it avoided those past issues. Freezer drawers are ok but tiniest annoyance is that 4 of the drawers have the pull handle at their base and 2 have the handle at the top lip of the drawer - always ends up a bit confusing trying to find the handle in the right spot.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 4 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	bbechtel08 · 7 months ago   Fantastic Refrigerator We love this refrigerator. Just the right size, quiet, great layout, flexible fourth compartment allows us to move between freezer and refrigerator when needed. Water dispenser is low profile and auto ice cube in freezer means thin doors and extra space for jars and bottles. Never thought we would use the 'wine' bottle holders that come with it but we use them for wine, beer, kombucha, etc. Allows one to more efficiently use overall space. Would definitely recommend this refrigerator. It replaces a 23 cu ft LG and would never go back.  Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	AnoopKV · 2 years ago   Most spacious and exemplary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We were looking for a refrigerator which was not too big in size but at the same time it was big enough for a growing family. This is exactly what we needed. The quad door allows you convert one compartment to fridge or freezer at your will gives you more fridge space than what other brands 670 odd litres refrigerator can't give.  The automatic Ice maker is located in freezer so that makes doors light and not so thick as compared to others.  Connecting refrigerator to water supply was easy peasy and didn't require any professional help.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 5 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆4 out of 5 stars.	ksm19 · 2 years ago   Quad Door Fridge/Freezer A compact fridge/freezer with four doors, ice maker and filtered water.

Steve · 2 years ago   Disappointed with F&P Delivered in June with damage to one of the doors. F&P service has tried 5 times to replace it. Replacement doors keep coming damaged. The new estimate is December. The tech said he would need my help to replace the door. Icemaker is ridiculously slow -- it makes about 10 ice cubes per day. Center shelf is fixed and has a ridge in the back which makes it only about 70% usable. The convertible bottom right is a really nice feature and It looks nice.

Fru Fru · a year ago   Fridge is good so far Great fridge so far but disappointed it didn’t come with a back cover . In terms of space , it is great. Water filter gets installed externally so make sure you have a space allocated around the fridge to attach the filter. The instructions on flushing the water before use were not very clear. For a being a more expensive fridge I expected it comes with a back cover . I have had it for a month now and so far happy with its functionality. Another thing I was a bit disappointed in was they it doesn’t show temperature for the fridge and freezer.

JP Ontario Canada · a month ago   Replacement refrigerator Our new refrigerator is replacing an older F & P model that had no replacement parts to repair the electrical fault in the pivoting central flap. This new model has improved its door hinges which closes the doors gently compared to the issues with our older fridge. The new LED lighting is brighter and we appreciate the overall interior space and exterior water outlet which doesn't take any space away within the door. The only concern is the frequent noise that it makes while operating. It seems to be louder that other makes.

The freezer is lacking space and a real pain to find frozen items; also if the freezer is full & you have items in plastic it tends to grab it and jamm ard you'll have a hard time opening the freezer. The shelves in the refrigeration portion cannot be moved as well as the ones on the side doors. The company we bought it from the just installed but gave no tips or instructions.

It looks very sleek and performs beautifully all our family and guests have admired it, it just looks so good! It may be a bit more expensive but you can sure see Quality.

KellyS · a year ago   Ice maker defrosting issues, can't get them repaired This is my third F&P counter depth fridge, but the other 2 did not have the ice maker/water dispenser. Welp, it took about 3 months of use for the ice maker to start leaking water down below to the freezer floor, where it forms a sheet, then slowly leaks out onto the kitchen floor. I had 2 service calls where they melted the ice build up but weren't able to fix the leak. I tried turning off the ice maker - the amount of leaks became much less, but it still leaks. I've only had this unit installed for 6 months.  build.com	Originally posted on build.com * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	Amy · a year ago   Best refrigerator EVER!! Very pleasing exterior design, easy height of handles (for children as well as adults). Not difficult to open doors as some other high-end brands. Excellent interior engineering to allow maximum use of shelf space and drawer space. The removable drawers are ten times easier to use than most other brand refrigerators. Makes food prep a breeze, and for spills, drawer clean-up is much, much easier. The water dispenser does not take up any “real estate” inside the refrigerator!! The design is superb!  build.com	Originally posted on build.com * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	Flyfisher · 8 months ago   Beautiful yet simple-Excellent refrigerator The french door refrigerator has beautiful simple lines in the outside and inside. The shelving system is easy to adjust. The different zones do what they are supposed to do for meat, vegetables and frozen foods. The shallow water dispenser is just right in size. The bottom drawer freezer with the shelf for most used items is easy to access. We’ve had no issues thus far and hope that the longevity will be as good as the refrigerator is beautiful.

Essy2022 · a year ago   Good but could do with improvements This fridge looks sleek. Love the large fresh food compartments and smaller tray pull out compartment at the bottom however there could be some improvements. Would be ideal if these compartments could be separated (left and right side) as you currently have to open both doors in order to access which is inconvenient. Also I wish the compartments could be pulled out a bit further to make access to items towards the back easier.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 4 out of 5    Quality Quality, 4 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    1–8 of 30 Reviews  Previous Reviews◄ Next Reviews► REGISTER YOUR PRODUCT  RESOLVE AN ISSUE  BOOK A SERVICE  PRODUCTS  Cooking Ventilation Cooling Dishwashing Laundry Parts & Accessories INSPIRATION  Experience Centers Projects Articles OUR STORY  About Us History Careers HELP & SUPPORT  Delivery & Installation Cancellation and Returns FAQ and Contact Us QUICK LINKS  Trade Resources Promotions Connected Living CHANGE LOCATION  United States Facebook Instagram YouTube Houzz Privacy Terms & Conditions Disclaimer Sitemap © Fisher & Paykel Appliances Ltd 2023  NKBA Member of National Kitchen & Bath Association"

Maria in leucadia · 2 years ago   Great fridge, great quality & capacity Love this fridge. Didn’t know much about the brand, but the Kitchenaid fridge we ordered arrived with a defect & a replacement wasn’t available due to pandemic/supply chain issues. ssles shent suggested this one, as it met our dimension requirements. The superior quality was immediately evident compared to the kitchenaid. This also had more capacity, particularly freezer portion. It’s quiet, efficient & just all around more solid. We needed a new gas cooktop a few months later, but couldn’t get the fisher paykel anywhere (supply chain issues again). We were so sad but couldn’t wait, so got a Bosch. It’s ok, but I bet not as good as the FP. would totally buy the brand again.  Review photo 1.Photo This action will open a modal dialog.Review photo 1.

LeslieB · 11 months ago   Great refrigerator We are loving our new refrigerator! The lighting is great, it's simple and organized inside and very easy to clean. The quality is lovely. The style is beautiful. Just a couple of notes as far as fit - although this was my first choice when looking around online I took it off my list because it seemed it would not fit in our opening. However when I measured in person, the doors (which are outside of the inset) are a bit higher than the hinges so it fit perfectly. Also, I have cabinet on both sides. The doors on many refrigerators open to the outside so that the door thickness will hit the cabinets if opened more than 90 degrees. These hinges are different, the doors open out and inside so that they do not hit the cabinets on the side. Be sure to take a look at this one!

Happy Seniors · 2 years ago   No backaches now!! This is the first time we have purchased a French door refrigerator. It is so much easier to reach items. We love that the ice maker is inside, thus providing much more room in the doors. We also like the extra freezer drawer for flatter items. Finally with little (or big ones) in the house the finger proof feature is a valuable feature for those of us who like the look of a clean refrigerator with less hassle. We recommend this highly.

Some of the features are very good, including, (1) The triple-double drawer freezer units with an icemaker. One of the draws is actually a hidden drawer in the lower unit that is ideal for storing pizzas and other flat items. 2.

Marengo · 3 days ago   ºF variations measured top2bottom The good: it looks great - that all of exterior allows magnets is a plus - it's easy to organize the refrigerator space - no ice-maker to deal with (previous refrigerator, sans ice-maker lasted 34 years) - greatly like the individual temperature controls for refrigerator and freezer - this is the refrigerator that I wanted in looks and features and it meets my goals  The questionable: the temperature variations, specifically I see a 8-10º F variation between top of refrigerator compartment and the lower shelves of the refrigerator. I'm using a pair of Yolink temp humidity sensors and it's changed my placement of things. Specifically, dairy now goes to the bottom shelf, where it is coldest. I set the refrigerator cooling to one of the lower settings (2 or 3 dots), while the freezer is set to 1 dot to keep it around -3º F. The temperature varies throughout the day, but sticks close to the target temperatures now. I avoid freezing any part of the refrigerator, so that is the driver for the present setting in the refrigerator compartment.  The bad: the freezer is smallish & organization of items a bit more difficult - calculated door clearances, but didn't anticipate that open drawers might dent the open frig doors.  PS: it would be nice if these reviews would be able to be updated over the years, this F&Paykel is only two months old. I keep my appliances for the long term if they are durable. This is a premium, no ice-maker, refrigerator. I think that a thermostat setting control would make this more awesome. Increasing the amount of airflow would make the frig more even in temperature.  the left frig door can be dinged by the door to the left if not careful, while the refrigerator door on the right can get dinged by an open cabinet drawerPhoto This action will open a modal dialog.the left frig door can be dinged by the door to the left if not careful, while the refrigerator door on the right can get dinged by an open cabinet drawer Our F&P refrigerator helps organize our small kitchen with lots of magnet action, we use the ""hidden"" right side for knives and paper towelsPhoto This action will open a modal dialog.Our F&P refrigerator helps organize our small kitchen with lots of magnet action, we use the ""hidden"" right side for knives and paper towels Design Design, 5 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	G. Wendell · a year ago   So far so good Purchased about a month ago after almost a year searching for a white French door refrigerator. So far so good. The only con is that it doesn’t have an ice maker. The drawers and shelves are made with thick plastic and glass. The drawers have inserts that can be removed for cleaning. The door shelves have well made dividers that slide to separate bottles as needed. The butter compartment is quite large and there is one on each door for other items like small jars. I have a family of 4 and the size has worked for us, however, we have a second refrigerator and freezer in the garage for items not frequently used.

I am very glad to have a WORKING refrigerator--my ""top of the line and beautiful old one, was on it's 3 compressor in 8 years and every two - three months, would ""freeze up and just quit working"".

This was just about the only one available. It was more money than we wanted to spend, but it fits perfectly and looks great. The door bins are a tight fit our gallon milk containers; they get slightly squished and are a bit hard to get in and out. We have decided it is just easier to put the milk in the main part of the fridge, and use the capacious door bins for juice, etc. It is a bit annoying that both fridge doors have to be opened in order to slide the trays out that hold produce. We are getting used to that. We do like the four clear bins, that make veggies and fruits easy and pretty to see. They are also easy to remove to clean.The covered top door bins (for butter) are so high up that they cannot be seen into. Maybe a place to store “cold cash” 😉?

Martin · a year ago   Freestanding French Door Refrigerator Freezer, 90c This is basically a good fridge. It looks good and I chose it for the Fisher and Paykel brand. There are a few small issues such as you can't access the drawers in the bottom of the fridge unless you open both doors and although the manual said the factory temp setting should maintain the fridge and freezer at optimal temps I found that it was running a bit too warm so had to wind it almost to the max cold setting to get those temperatures where they should be which means it will likely use more power than stated. The doors also don't self close which might just be a French Door thing as I have never had this style of fridge before. There is however an alarm that sounds if you don't close the doors after a certain amount of time to help with that. Going by the Fisher and Paykel reputation I would expect to get many many years of use out of this fridge so even though there are a few niggles we have adapted and it works well.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 4 out of 5    Quality Quality, 4 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	Quikhems · 5 months ago   A wonderful appliance I purchased this refrigerator to go along with the Fisher Paykel range purchased. It is counter depth which is great. I did not get it with an ice maker, so there is more room inside the fridge. The freezer as well holds a lot. When it is running, you barely hear it. Just a wonderful appliance.

Annie · 6 months ago   Honest review I have never used induction and I generally do not embrace change but I am so glad I did. I wanted a pizza mode and the pizza is great. I can buy pizza dough at Publix and I just roll it out. The pizza is great. Secondly, I can boil water in literally less than a min. I have very few pots because of the expense. But it’s fine. Everything that I was concerned about was seriously misguided. The look of the oven is fantastic. I am so happy with it.  Review photo 1.Photo This action will open a modal dialog.Review photo 1.

Sonoma Rick · a year ago   Now We Are Really ""Cooking With Gas"" An amazing experience. It took a lot of time and patience to convince my spouse that we should buy an induction range. Like me a few years ago, she thought gas was best for cooking. Now she raves about the induction cooktop. But wait, the oven is unbelievable. With double fans for ""Aero"" convection roasting and baking, among 8 oven settings, this is the most amazing oven we have ever seen.  I was a little disappointed the setting for the oven only goes down to 200F (except for the Rapid Proof setting). Serious Eats/Food Lab recipes for prime rib, porchetta, and other large roasts call for slow roasting for several hours at 150F to an internal temp of about 120-125F followed by a rest and then a 550F sear for 6-10 minutes, which this oven delivers--big time!  Induction and the options for oven settings do take a little getting used to and checking the owner's manual, but if you are really, really serious about cooking, the effort will pay back big time.

Leighton Beach · a year ago   Beastie bestie [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This unit from Fisher Paykel is an absolute beast. The induction top is the best, the big controls on the front like gas are awesome, and out of the way of stovetop spills etc. The advantage over gas is that they give the absolute precision of induction. And the temperature range goes both lower and higher than the expensive but tedious gas cooktop we replaced. The oven is by far the best oven I have ever used. It is very accurate, very responsive, very large, and the shelves are commercial grade. Whatever you load up they just roll in and out without fuss.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 5 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	Lena · 19 days ago   Excellent stove I was hesitant about the induction range because I used to have electric stove and it was super slow. Induction stove is totally a game changer. It cooks fast and so easy to clean. The style is classic and look beautiful on my new kitchen renovations. Most of the luxury stoves are too big and stick out from the countertops like 5 inches if your interior designer is not experienced. This stove is different. It is lined up with the standard cabinetry & countertops. The induction stove meets both aesthetic & functions. I highly recommend it.  Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	Anna · a year ago   The Best Range I’ve Ever Owned This is the 2nd time I’ve owned an electric range with induction cooktop, and this one is the best. Here are 6 features I love the most: 1. The cooktop is roomy and has lots of settings — including 3 warm/simmer settings, 9 power levels, and a power boost for quick boil 2. The cooktop is easy to clean (I use Weiman cleaner which is sold at my food store) 3. The oven has fans / convection options for baking and broiling (Aero Bake for single shelf & True Aero for multi-shelf) which produces excellent bakery - perfect muffins, cookies, bread etc.; Aero Broil for chicken & fish which produces amazingly tender and not-dried-out results. 4. Below the oven there’s a warming drawer with 3 settings 5. The knobs are lovely and easy to use (I prefer knobs to digital). All the functions, such as setting the clock and the timer, are easy to figure out without even having to read the instruction manual. 6. The instruction manual gives advise on which oven function to use, when you’re in doubt or just want to experiment. There’s an Aero Pastry & Pizza function, and even a Rapid Proof function for dough. And of course, Self-Clean. Cons / Downsides: 1. Unlike my previous induction cooktop (Samsung), the burners do not have a blue “flame” that surrounds the pan or pot when it’s in use. That was cool, and if you’re used to a gas burner, it’s a nod to those of us who like to cook on a flame. 2. The induction style of cooking —on any brand — can make a clicking noise when a pot or pan is in use, at least for the first minute or so. This is because the magnetic energy causes the layers of metal in the cookware to kind of vibrate as they warm up. But it depends on what cookware you use. My solid cast iron skillet makes no noise when in use. And honestly, it’s a subtle sound and you get used to it. I give the Fisher & Paykel 5 stars, and highly recommend it for those who love to cook & bake…. Or just look at a beautiful appliance!

Acey Trey · a year ago   Mostly Good This range pretty much has it all. Low proofing setting. 550 degree maximum oven. Warming drawer. Cooktop bridging zones. All in a stylish design. We have had four issues: 1. You can't reduce stock overnight. The top elements have a ""safety"" feature that turns them off after a few hours, This is not described anywhere in the manuals - and it can not be turned off. Therefore, stocks and sauces can be a problem. 2. The range is ""counter depth"", which means if you have a deep counter as we do, a filler piece is needed to fill the gap left when an old range is taken out. 3. If debris gets between the layers of glass on the oven door (which it has already on ours), you can't get it out on your own. The manual calls for factory service. 4. The stainless steel around the cooktop is vulnerable to scratches.  Design Design, 4 out of 5    Quality Quality, 4 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆3 out of 5 stars.	Asheville foodie · 4 days ago   Too tricked up This is my third induction range and the induction is excellent as is always the case. Ease of use not so great. Very difficult to see which knob controls which burner. The top bar( one of two!) is totally in the way, knobs turn counterintuitively. Oven is more complicated than necessary.

Annie · 6 months ago   Honest review I have never used induction and I generally do not embrace change but I am so glad I did. I wanted a pizza mode and the pizza is great. I can buy pizza dough at Publix and I just roll it out. The pizza is great. Secondly, I can boil water in literally less than a min. I have very few pots because of the expense. But it’s fine. Everything that I was concerned about was seriously misguided. The look of the oven is fantastic. I am so happy with it.  Review photo 1.Photo This action will open a modal dialog.Review photo 1.

Sonoma Rick · a year ago   Now We Are Really ""Cooking With Gas"" An amazing experience. It took a lot of time and patience to convince my spouse that we should buy an induction range. Like me a few years ago, she thought gas was best for cooking. Now she raves about the induction cooktop. But wait, the oven is unbelievable. With double fans for ""Aero"" convection roasting and baking, among 8 oven settings, this is the most amazing oven we have ever seen.  I was a little disappointed the setting for the oven only goes down to 200F (except for the Rapid Proof setting). Serious Eats/Food Lab recipes for prime rib, porchetta, and other large roasts call for slow roasting for several hours at 150F to an internal temp of about 120-125F followed by a rest and then a 550F sear for 6-10 minutes, which this oven delivers--big time!  Induction and the options for oven settings do take a little getting used to and checking the owner's manual, but if you are really, really serious about cooking, the effort will pay back big time.  Love this stove!  Review photo 1.Photo This action will open a modal dialog.Review photo 1.

Lena · 19 days ago   Excellent stove I was hesitant about the induction range because I used to have electric stove and it was super slow. Induction stove is totally a game changer. It cooks fast and so easy to clean. The style is classic and look beautiful on my new kitchen renovations. Most of the luxury stoves are too big and stick out from the countertops like 5 inches if your interior designer is not experienced. This stove is different. It is lined up with the standard cabinetry & countertops. The induction stove meets both aesthetic & functions. I highly recommend it.  Experience Experience, 5 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆5 out of 5 stars.	Anna · a year ago   The Best Range I’ve Ever Owned This is the 2nd time I’ve owned an electric range with induction cooktop, and this one is the best. Here are 6 features I love the most: 1. The cooktop is roomy and has lots of settings — including 3 warm/simmer settings, 9 power levels, and a power boost for quick boil 2. The cooktop is easy to clean (I use Weiman cleaner which is sold at my food store) 3. The oven has fans / convection options for baking and broiling (Aero Bake for single shelf & True Aero for multi-shelf) which produces excellent bakery - perfect muffins, cookies, bread etc.; Aero Broil for chicken & fish which produces amazingly tender and not-dried-out results. 4. Below the oven there’s a warming drawer with 3 settings 5. The knobs are lovely and easy to use (I prefer knobs to digital). All the functions, such as setting the clock and the timer, are easy to figure out without even having to read the instruction manual. 6. The instruction manual gives advise on which oven function to use, when you’re in doubt or just want to experiment. There’s an Aero Pastry & Pizza function, and even a Rapid Proof function for dough. And of course, Self-Clean. Cons / Downsides: 1. Unlike my previous induction cooktop (Samsung), the burners do not have a blue “flame” that surrounds the pan or pot when it’s in use. That was cool, and if you’re used to a gas burner, it’s a nod to those of us who like to cook on a flame. 2. The induction style of cooking —on any brand — can make a clicking noise when a pot or pan is in use, at least for the first minute or so. This is because the magnetic energy causes the layers of metal in the cookware to kind of vibrate as they warm up. But it depends on what cookware you use. My solid cast iron skillet makes no noise when in use. And honestly, it’s a subtle sound and you get used to it. I give the Fisher & Paykel 5 stars, and highly recommend it for those who love to cook & bake…. Or just look at a beautiful appliance!

Acey Trey · a year ago   Mostly Good This range pretty much has it all. Low proofing setting. 550 degree maximum oven. Warming drawer. Cooktop bridging zones. All in a stylish design. We have had four issues: 1. You can't reduce stock overnight. The top elements have a ""safety"" feature that turns them off after a few hours, This is not described anywhere in the manuals - and it can not be turned off. Therefore, stocks and sauces can be a problem. 2. The range is ""counter depth"", which means if you have a deep counter as we do, a filler piece is needed to fill the gap left when an old range is taken out. 3. If debris gets between the layers of glass on the oven door (which it has already on ours), you can't get it out on your own. The manual calls for factory service. 4. The stainless steel around the cooktop is vulnerable to scratches.  Design Design, 4 out of 5    Quality Quality, 4 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆3 out of 5 stars.	Asheville foodie · 4 days ago   Too tricked up This is my third induction range and the induction is excellent as is always the case. Ease of use not so great. Very difficult to see which knob controls which burner. The top bar( one of two!) is totally in the way, knobs turn counterintuitively. Oven is more complicated than necessary. I’m a serious cook and this range has too gadgetry.

It boils water so fast. Our gas range was 18 years old. It took no time to get used to the new one. It’s so easy to keep the surface clean. It checks all the boxes. We got new pots and pans.

Chef Martin · 3 months ago   Fisher & Paykel OR90SCG6W1 freestanding cooker Our new F&P freestanding oven looks great and works well. We haven’t used all the features yet but is very easy to use and keep clean. We haven’t used the pizza or self cleaning functions yet but are looking forward to in future. We love using the rotisserie. Great value for money when compared with features offered, looks and the pull out drawer to warm plates gives an upper edge to competition in this price point. We look forward to a lifetime of cooking.

KazJaz1 · 2 years ago   A good looking cooker but..... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had to replace our old cooker so I spent quite a while looking for a new one that I liked the look of and would suit the look of our kitchen. I went for the Fisher & Paykel because it looked good and was recommended by all the sales assistants that I spoke to, also my daughter had just purchased the same cooker. After having the cooker for several months there are lots of things about it that I like but also a few that I don’t. The space between the glass door which you can’t remove to clean is a big no. The dough proofing setting does not work. The sliding shelves have discoloured after cleaning.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 3 out of 5    Quality Quality, 3 out of 5    Experience Experience, 3 out of 5    Response from fisherandpaykel-au: Global Support Centre · 2 years ago   Thank you for your feedback.

She is very happy with the all the functions of the oven but most of the self-cleaning ability and the warming drawer which makes her cooking experiences even better.

Mez68 · 2 years ago   Great oven [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using my oven for approx 6 months. Love the cooktop size and cooking ability. The cooktop is easy to remove for cleaning or wipe down. As is the outside of the oven (ours is black) and the outside is streak-free. The oven size is wonderful, the full extension shelves held a cast-iron crockpot with no issues. The oven functions are terrific, we are still perfecting but the pizza and rotisserie functions worked well. The functions dial is easy to use and I use the timer on the oven all the time, something I did not use on my previous oven as it was cumbersome. I have not used the warmer draw. The self-clean works wonderful, which brings me to only a four-star rating, Why are the shelves not made of the same material as the side shelves so they self-clean? Also, the oven door has a rather large gap at the top so it becomes dirty between the front and back oven door glass.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 4 out of 5    Quality Quality, 5 out of 5    Experience Experience, 4 out of 5    * ☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆3 out of 5 stars.	ScottA · 2 years ago   F&P oven review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We renovated our house and the kitchen was included. Decided we wanted a stand out feature so convinced the wife on the black F&P oven. Got it in and it looks great. Unfortunately the cooking internally has not been great and it's very loud - like a 747 flying past the kitchen. It also makes a loud noise when cooling down. The gas cooktop is great.  fisherpaykel.com/au	Originally posted on fisherpaykel.com/au Design Design, 3 out of 5    Quality Quality, 4 out of 5    Experience Experience, 3 out of 5    Response from fisherandpaykel-au: Global Support Centre · 2 years ago   Thank you for leaving your feedback, we strive incredibly hard to provide moments of delight to our customers and we’re really sorry we’ve not been able to fully meet your expectations this time.  We will be sure to pass on this valuable feedback to our product design team for their continual process improvements.  A cooling fan in the oven runs to keep the oven door and control panel cool at all times. It may continue to run after the oven has been turned off for safety reasons.

SABERFORGE / ECO APPRENTICE SABER
BASTION MK2 ECO
SKU: SFECO-BAS2-S01

$79.99
The Bastion Mk2 Eco saber the Eco version of our Apprentice Bastion. It features a windowed emitter and matching pommel with milled grip details. The saber also includes a comfortable grip point for spins and flourishes.

For our new Mk2 eco sabers, we have increased the outer diameter, which allowed us to add more machined details. In addition, the Apprentice Eco Mk2 sabers now accept the new LGT/Nexus cores with micro USB-C charging, which allowed us to delete the button head screws seen in previous generations. We also adopted a traditional male-threaded pommel and female-threaded body. The Apprentice Eco Mk2 sabers use an M30x1 thread pitch, staff couplers are being machined now and will be available in November.

He is still thanking me for it a week after receiving it in the mail telling me how much he loves it and that ""You're the best mom ever!"" It's a fantastic gift for any mega fan of Star Wars. It looks so real, especially in pictures and photographs beautifully with the way the light from the saber reflects off the face and body. It really is something! I highly recommend!    20  Bastion Shoto 08/03/22 Elijah Layton  Great product Would absolutely buy from again  00  Bastion Shoto 01/27/22 Sean Dorwaldt  Broke during first time dualing  02  Bastion Shoto 11/07/21 N.S. Great but not perfect. I love this saber and its design! I have sparred with it on many occasions and it for sure is a nice shoto. Unlike the Acoloyte, it is the perfect offhand hilt size wise. I however wish to make two flaws known to buyers. The Activation switch will he hit on and off often. This is a small hilt and your hand will fit it but, the switch is very venerable. The second is that the top retention screw is easily lost as its tightening is very... high? I am unsure how to explain this really, just be careful when the blade is off.  Will buy the matching saber!  13  Bastion Shoto 08/12/21 Rick 10/10 will buy again! I got it today and so far it’s amazing blade came a little dirty but can be cleaned With a wipe. Shipped in 5 weeks late but ok. The buttons are sooooooo good this is my second saber and my first on from ultra sabers is in ok condition but I hated the button so this nice metal is amazing the color is bright and in the white I go it in is blinding. It can take hits well to my sister got her hands on it and hit the blade on the wall the blade was fine. The hilt is real metals and feels great. The only thing I dislike is how late it was.  32 12 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     Back to top of page SHOP  Eco Sabers Apprentice Sabers Elite Sabers Crystal Sabers Exotic Sabers Gift Cards SUPPORT  Orders & Shipping Returns Military/Teachers/First Responders More COMPANY  Privacy Policy Terms of Service NEWSLETTER  Email address  Customers rate us 4.6/5 © 2023, SaberForge Not associated with DISNEY, LUCASFILM Ltd. or any Lightsaber franchise.Use left/right arrows to navigate the slideshow or swipe left/right if using a mobile device"

Works right out of the box, looks fantastic and is well-detailed, sounds are loud enough, the hilt feels great in the hand especially with the leather wrap, and there's a variety of fun built-in features. Time will tell if the saber holds up over the years, but right now it's a worthy display piece.  Make sure to read up on the features to get the most out your saber. There are also gesture functions which I had to learn through YouTube.

It is definitely not ready to be given as a gift… the pieces are just separate in a brown delivery box, and there is no SaberForge packaging. There are also no instructions, so I guess I will need to look these up and print prior to Christmas, and include when I wrap it. I’m hopeful this is a sign that all the money I spent went into the quality of the product itself, as it was a bit pricey.

Solid build, iffy electronics Absolutely love the hilt, it's exactly what I was looking for, and the blade itself arrived with no damage and works great.  The only thing that isn't great is that the audio cuts out randomly and I can't figure out why. Also, the motion controls are pretty finicky and don't always do what you think they will. Also also, the saber clash effect seems to trigger sometimes without any clashing taking place, possibly something else with the electronics?  Overall really happy, but will probably look into getting the insides looked at, at some point.    10  Cleric (Wrapped) 04/05/22 Clem Duv  Cleric (Wrapped) with Veteran RGB It was my first ever time buying a lightsaber, and I absolutely love the result. I was hesitating between 2 hilts but I'm really happy I chose this one, it is beautiful. The Veteranb RGB electronic just give a real life feeling to the whole saber, I love it ! I've waited a long time before choosing where to buy my first lightsaber, and I'm sure I'll soon buy another here ! The delivery time felt like eternity but the result was worth it. Thanks !  10  Cleric (Wrapped) 03/22/22 Michael Gerken  Cleric Wrapped Review My lightsaber is amazing in every way possible and has been just wonderful. The only issue I had was one of the prongs was loose but I could easily tighten it.

I’ve been waiting a few weeks for customer service to get a hold of me on how to fix the problem. I personally would not recommend this saber.  40  Cleric 03/26/22 Timothy Corrin  Awesome saber Very happy with this saber. My only complaint is the silver vein finish. I thought it would be more black with silver running through the paint but it seems far more silver with only small hints of black underneath. Other than that I am very happy. I will definitely buy another saber from you guys in the future. I highly recommend the hero+ Neo pixel package. Being able to switch colors, effects, and sound fonts at will just really makes the saber feel top of the line and worth every penny. The hilt is a little longer than expected but that is actually a plus, allowing me to use it with one hand or two very comfortably. It’s also heavier than expected but that also gives it a very realistic and authentic feel, instead of feeling like it’s cheaply made out of plastic. The brightness of the Neo pixel blade is extremely surprising, even in well lit areas. The different sound fonts are very engaging and fun to play around with. The hardest thing was choosing which sound font i wanted to use since there are so many options I just found myself cycling through them non stop. All in all I give this saber 10/10. Expect another order from me soon!!!       10  Cleric 03/18/22 Joseph T.  A dream come true! I have dreamt of owning my very own lightsaber for as long as I have loved Star Wars and the Cleric has made that dream come true (and SaberForge)! I would recommend the weathered look as each one seems to be unique. The balance of the saber is great and when spinning, it feels comfortable. The quality of this saber is awesome (not that I have anything to compare it to as this is my first saber), but it does feel awesome (built quality and look - just have to make sure the emitter is screwed in tightly). It does help with strength and cardio while spinning as it is on the tad ""heavy"" side, but as stated, this is my first. The look and feel of this saber is awesome.  I live in Aus and I thought it would take longer to arrive but it arrived when expected and nothing seemed to be out of place. The only suggestion is I wished that SaberForge would send updates on the progress of the build. Apart from that, there is nothing at this stage to improve on.  The quality of the blade seems great as well. I have ""duelled"" against my 18month old daughter with her Kanan saber from K-mart and it held up its end of the battle. Looking forward to some choreographed duelling when my friends eventually buy their own (I have recommended SaberForgre to them all!). Thank you SaberForge and to the Cleric hilt design.       20  Cleric 10/13/21 Jason Garrett  Cleric Lightsaber Review The force is strong with this saber! The hilt looks amazing and feels great in your hand. I recommend the weathered look. I love how you can see part of blade through the hilt.    31  Cleric 09/19/21 Rob  My Cleric was delayed by a failed quality test...but the finished product seems perfect I ordered my Cleric with the Champion electronics package first, but reconsidered a week later and emailed asking if I could upgrade to Hero + Pixel, which they were able to do with no problem. My saber came a few weeks after the 12-15 weeks listed here, but when I emailed to ask about it I eventually got a response saying that it had failed a quality check so they were going back and fixing some things.  The end result looks to be a very solid lightsaber. The shrouds on my hilt don't have the stripped screws problem that I see reported here and elsewhere, and there's no play in them whatsoever. It is a bit bigger and heavier than I expected -- the site lists the length as 11.8 inches, but with the shrouds I measure it to be 13.5"" -- and I'm still getting used to the balance for spinning purposes. But it looks great, and I've gotten many positive comments from friends about it. This is also my first neopixel saber, and I'm having great fun playing around with the various lighting effects.    30 123 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     Back to top of page SHOP  Eco Sabers Apprentice Sabers Elite Sabers Crystal Sabers Exotic Sabers Gift Cards SUPPORT  Orders & Shipping Returns Military/Teachers/First Responders More COMPANY  Privacy Policy Terms of Service NEWSLETTER  Email address  Customers rate us 4.6/5 © 2023, SaberForge Not associated with DISNEY, LUCASFILM Ltd. or any Lightsaber franchise.Use left/right arrows to navigate the slideshow or swipe left/right if using a mobile device"
